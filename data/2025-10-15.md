### [1] [Approximate Proximal Operators for Analog Compressed Sensing Using PN-junction Diode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12065)
*Soma Furusawa,Taisei Kato,Ryo Hayakawa,Kazunori Hayashi*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用PN结二极管的正向伏安特性实现ℓ1和MCP正则化函数的近似邻近算子，用于模拟压缩感知系统，并通过计算机仿真验证了在考虑模拟器件噪声影响下的稀疏重构性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了实现模拟压缩感知，需要找到ℓ1和最小最大凹惩罚(MCP)正则化函数的近似邻近算子的实现方法。

Method: 利用PN结二极管的正向伏安特性设计电子模拟电路来实现近似邻近算子，并在压缩感知中使用近端梯度方法。

Result: 计算机仿真结果表明，使用所提出的近似邻近算子的算法在考虑模拟器件引入的加性噪声影响下，仍能保持良好的稀疏重构性能。

Conclusion: 基于PN结二极管的模拟电路能够有效实现ℓ1和MCP正则化函数的近似邻近算子，为模拟压缩感知系统提供了可行的实现方案。

Abstract: In order to realize analog compressed sensing, the paper considers
approximate proximal operators of the $\ell_1$ and minimax concave penalty
(MCP) regularization functions. Specifically, we propose to realize the
approximate functions by an electric analog circuit using forward
voltage-current (V-I) characteristics of the PN-junction diodes. To confirm the
validity of the proposed approach, we employ the proposed approximate proximal
operators for the $\ell_1$ and MCP regularization functions in compressed
sensing with the proximal gradient method. The sparse reconstruction
performance of the algorithms using the proposed approximate proximal operators
is demonstrated via computer simulations taking into account the impact of
additive noise introduced by analog devices.

### [2] [Hybrid centralized-distributed precoding in fronthaul-constrained CF-mMIMO systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12406)
*Zahra Mobini,Hien Quoc Ngo,Ardavan Rahimian,Anvar Tukmanov,David Townend,Michail Matthaiou,Simon L. Cotton*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合集中-分布式预编码策略，用于前传受限的无蜂窝大规模MIMO系统，通过动态用户分组和功率控制来最大化总频谱效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决前传受限的无蜂窝大规模MIMO系统中，如何在有限前传容量下平衡集中式和分布式预编码的性能优势。

Method: 将用户分为两组，分别采用集中式和分布式预编码服务，并构建优化问题来联合优化用户分组和功率控制，同时满足前传和接入点功率约束。

Result: 数值结果表明，混合方案在各种系统配置下始终优于完全集中式和完全分布式方法，展现出更好的性能和适应性。

Conclusion: 所提出的混合预编码策略在前传受限的无蜂窝大规模MIMO系统中具有显著优势，能够根据前传和频谱效率需求动态调整，实现性能优化。

Abstract: We investigate a fronthaul-limited cell-free massive multiple-input
multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system and propose a hybrid centralized-distributed
precoding strategy that dynamically adapts to varying fronthaul and spectral
efficiency (SE) requirements. The proposed approach divides users into two
groups: one served by centralized precoding and the other by distributed
precoding. We formulate a novel optimization problem for user grouping and
power control aimed at maximizing the sum SE, subject to fronthaul and
per-access point (AP) power constraints. To tackle the problem, we transform it
into a tractable form and propose efficient solution algorithms. Numerical
results confirm the hybrid scheme's versatility and superior performance,
consistently outperforming fully centralized and distributed approaches across
diverse system configurations.

### [3] [Phase Transitions of the Additive Uniform Noise Channel with Peak Amplitude and Cost Constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12427)
*Jonas Stapmanns,Catarina Dias,Luke Eilers,Tobias Kühn,Jean-Pascal Pfister*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文分析了在加性均匀噪声信道下，量化在什么条件下是最优的。研究发现，当成本函数为凹函数时，容量达到的输入分布是离散的；当成本函数为凸函数且成本约束有效时，容量达到的输入分布支撑整个区间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量化在什么条件下是最优的，特别是在加性均匀噪声信道中，考虑峰值幅度和成本约束的情况。

Method: 在加性均匀噪声信道下，考虑峰值幅度和成本约束，计算容量达到的输入分布随噪声水平、平均成本约束和成本函数曲率的变化。

Result: 当成本函数为凹函数时，容量达到的输入分布是离散的；当成本函数为凸函数且成本约束有效时，容量达到的输入分布支撑整个区间。对于离散容量达到输入分布的情况，推导了信道容量的解析表达式。

Conclusion: 量化在成本函数为凹函数时是最优的，而在成本函数为凸函数且成本约束有效时，连续输入分布是最优的。

Abstract: Under which condition is quantization optimal? We address this question in
the context of the additive uniform noise channel under peak amplitude and cost
constraints. We compute analytically the capacity-achieving input distribution
as a function of the noise level, the average cost constraint, and the
curvature of the cost function. We find that when the cost function is concave,
the capacity-achieving input distribution is discrete, whereas when the cost
function is convex and the cost constraint is active, the support of the
capacity-achieving input distribution spans the entire interval. For the cases
of a discrete capacity-achieving input distribution, we derive the analytical
expressions for the capacity of the channel.

### [4] [BlackIce: A Containerized Red Teaming Toolkit for AI Security Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11823)
*Caelin Kaplan,Alexander Warnecke,Neil Archibald*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BlackIce是一个开源容器化工具包，用于对大型语言模型和传统机器学习模型进行红队测试，提供可复现的Docker镜像，集成了14个精选的开源工具，通过统一命令行界面简化AI模型安全评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型在现实系统中的集成日益增多，引发对其安全性的担忧。现有AI红队测试工具选择困难，依赖管理复杂，需要降低入门门槛并建立标准化环境。

Method: 受Kali Linux启发，开发了BlackIce容器化工具包，包含14个精选开源工具，提供版本固定的Docker镜像和统一命令行界面，支持模块化扩展。

Result: BlackIce提供了可复现的测试环境，简化了红队评估的启动过程，支持本地或云端部署，便于社区扩展。

Conclusion: BlackIce通过容器化方法解决了AI红队测试的工具选择和依赖管理问题，为AI模型安全评估提供了标准化、易扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: AI models are being increasingly integrated into real-world systems, raising
significant concerns about their safety and security. Consequently, AI red
teaming has become essential for organizations to proactively identify and
address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by adversaries. While
numerous AI red teaming tools currently exist, practitioners face challenges in
selecting the most appropriate tools from a rapidly expanding landscape, as
well as managing complex and frequently conflicting software dependencies
across isolated projects. Given these challenges and the relatively small
number of organizations with dedicated AI red teams, there is a strong need to
lower barriers to entry and establish a standardized environment that
simplifies the setup and execution of comprehensive AI model assessments.
  Inspired by Kali Linux's role in traditional penetration testing, we
introduce BlackIce, an open-source containerized toolkit designed for red
teaming Large Language Models (LLMs) and classical machine learning (ML)
models. BlackIce provides a reproducible, version-pinned Docker image that
bundles 14 carefully selected open-source tools for Responsible AI and Security
testing, all accessible via a unified command-line interface. With this setup,
initiating red team assessments is as straightforward as launching a container,
either locally or using a cloud platform. Additionally, the image's modular
architecture facilitates community-driven extensions, allowing users to easily
adapt or expand the toolkit as new threats emerge. In this paper, we describe
the architecture of the container image, the process used for selecting tools,
and the types of evaluations they support.

### [5] [Countermind: A Multi-Layered Security Architecture for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11837)
*Dominik Schwarz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出Countermind多层安全架构，通过语义边界逻辑、参数空间限制、自调节核心和多模态输入沙箱等机制，从被动防御转向主动的推理前和推理中安全执行，以应对LLM应用中的提示注入和越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于输出过滤的防御方法脆弱且无法解决根本问题——模型无法区分可信指令和不可信数据。需要从被动防御转向主动的推理前和推理中安全执行。

Method: 1. 语义边界逻辑(SBL)和时间耦合文本加密器减少明文提示注入攻击面；2. 参数空间限制(PSR)动态控制LLM对内部语义簇的访问；3. 自调节核心使用OODA循环和学习安全模块；4. 多模态输入沙箱和上下文防御机制。

Result: 提出了评估计划，旨在量化该架构在降低表单优先攻击成功率(ASR)方面的有效性，并测量其潜在延迟开销。

Conclusion: Countermind架构通过多层安全机制，为LLM应用提供了从被动防御到主动安全执行的系统性解决方案，有望显著提升对抗提示注入和越狱攻击的能力。

Abstract: The security of Large Language Model (LLM) applications is fundamentally
challenged by "form-first" attacks like prompt injection and jailbreaking,
where malicious instructions are embedded within user inputs. Conventional
defenses, which rely on post hoc output filtering, are often brittle and fail
to address the root cause: the model's inability to distinguish trusted
instructions from untrusted data. This paper proposes Countermind, a
multi-layered security architecture intended to shift defenses from a reactive,
post hoc posture to a proactive, pre-inference, and intra-inference enforcement
model. The architecture proposes a fortified perimeter designed to structurally
validate and transform all inputs, and an internal governance mechanism
intended to constrain the model's semantic processing pathways before an output
is generated. The primary contributions of this work are conceptual designs
for: (1) A Semantic Boundary Logic (SBL) with a mandatory, time-coupled Text
Crypter intended to reduce the plaintext prompt injection attack surface,
provided all ingestion paths are enforced. (2) A Parameter-Space Restriction
(PSR) mechanism, leveraging principles from representation engineering, to
dynamically control the LLM's access to internal semantic clusters, with the
goal of mitigating semantic drift and dangerous emergent behaviors. (3) A
Secure, Self-Regulating Core that uses an OODA loop and a learning security
module to adapt its defenses based on an immutable audit log. (4) A Multimodal
Input Sandbox and Context-Defense mechanisms to address threats from
non-textual data and long-term semantic poisoning. This paper outlines an
evaluation plan designed to quantify the proposed architecture's effectiveness
in reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for form-first attacks and to measure
its potential latency overhead.

### [6] [Robust ML-based Detection of Conventional, LLM-Generated, and Adversarial Phishing Emails Using Advanced Text Preprocessing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11915)
*Deeksha Hareesha Kulal,Chidozie Princewill Arannonu,Afsah Anwar,Nidhi Rastogi,Quamar Niyaz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对LLM生成的钓鱼邮件的鲁棒检测系统，通过增强的文本预处理流程和机器学习算法，在对抗性攻击和LLM生成钓鱼邮件场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)能够生成语法正确、上下文相关的钓鱼邮件，使传统检测机制失效，需要开发更鲁棒的检测系统来应对这一新兴威胁。

Method: 采用增强的文本预处理流程（包括拼写纠正和分词），结合自然语言处理特征提取技术和机器学习算法，构建钓鱼邮件检测系统。

Result: 在公开数据集上达到94.26%的检测准确率和84.39%的F1分数，在对抗性攻击和LLM生成钓鱼邮件测试中表现出良好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提出的系统能够有效应对由LLM和对抗性技术生成的钓鱼邮件，为应对AI驱动的钓鱼威胁提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Phishing remains a critical cybersecurity threat, especially with the advent
of large language models (LLMs) capable of generating highly convincing
malicious content. Unlike earlier phishing attempts which are identifiable by
grammatical errors, misspellings, incorrect phrasing, and inconsistent
formatting, LLM generated emails are grammatically sound, contextually
relevant, and linguistically natural. These advancements make phishing emails
increasingly difficult to distinguish from legitimate ones, challenging
traditional detection mechanisms. Conventional phishing detection systems often
fail when faced with emails crafted by LLMs or manipulated using adversarial
perturbation techniques. To address this challenge, we propose a robust
phishing email detection system featuring an enhanced text preprocessing
pipeline. This pipeline includes spelling correction and word splitting to
counteract adversarial modifications and improve detection accuracy. Our
approach integrates widely adopted natural language processing (NLP) feature
extraction techniques and machine learning algorithms. We evaluate our models
on publicly available datasets comprising both phishing and legitimate emails,
achieving a detection accuracy of 94.26% and F1-score of 84.39% in model
deployment setting. To assess robustness, we further evaluate our models using
adversarial phishing samples generated by four attack methods in Python
TextAttack framework. Additionally, we evaluate models' performance against
phishing emails generated by LLMs including ChatGPT and Llama. Results
highlight the resilience of models against evolving AI-powered phishing
threats.

### [7] [Noisy Neighbor: Exploiting RDMA for Resource Exhaustion Attacks in Containerized Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12629)
*Gunwoo Kim,Taejune Park,Jinwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文分析了NVIDIA BlueField-3 RDMA NIC上的两种资源耗尽攻击：状态饱和攻击和流水线饱和攻击，并提出了HT-Verbs框架来缓解这些威胁，实现性能隔离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现代容器化云环境中，RDMA的采用需要强性能隔离以确保一个容器的RDMA工作负载不会降低其他容器的性能，但现有隔离技术难以有效应用。

Method: 实验分析两种资源耗尽攻击，并提出HT-Verbs框架，基于实时每容器RDMA动词遥测和自适应资源分类，将RNIC资源划分为热、温、冷层级并限制滥用工作负载。

Result: 状态饱和攻击导致受害者容器带宽损失高达93.9%，延迟增加1117倍，缓存未命中率上升115%；流水线饱和攻击导致严重链路级拥塞和显著放大效应。

Conclusion: HT-Verbs框架能够缓解RDMA资源耗尽攻击威胁，恢复可预测的安全保证，无需硬件修改。

Abstract: In modern containerized cloud environments, the adoption of RDMA (Remote
Direct Memory Access) has expanded to reduce CPU overhead and enable
high-performance data exchange. Achieving this requires strong performance
isolation to ensure that one container's RDMA workload does not degrade the
performance of others, thereby maintaining critical security assurances.
However, existing isolation techniques are difficult to apply effectively due
to the complexity of microarchitectural resource management within RDMA NICs
(RNICs). This paper experimentally analyzes two types of resource exhaustion
attacks on NVIDIA BlueField-3: (i) state saturation attacks and (ii) pipeline
saturation attacks. Our results show that state saturation attacks can cause up
to a 93.9% loss in bandwidth, a 1,117x increase in latency, and a 115% rise in
cache misses for victim containers, while pipeline saturation attacks lead to
severe link-level congestion and significant amplification, where small verb
requests result in disproportionately high resource consumption. To mitigate
these threats and restore predictable security assurances, we propose HT-Verbs,
a threshold-driven framework based on real-time per-container RDMA verb
telemetry and adaptive resource classification that partitions RNIC resources
into hot, warm, and cold tiers and throttles abusive workloads without
requiring hardware modifications.

### [8] [Adding All Flavors: A Hybrid Random Number Generator for dApps and Web3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12062)
*Ranjith Chodavarapu,Rabimba Karanjai,Xinxin Fan,Weidong Shi,Lei Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物联网设备和可信执行环境（TEE）的混合随机数生成方案，通过聚合多个随机源来为去中心化应用提供随机数，只需一个诚实随机源即可保证最终随机数的无偏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机数生成机制存在局限性：链上方法易受攻击者影响输入，链下方法安全假设强且复杂度高。需要一种平衡不同因素的框架来为dApp提供可靠随机数。

Method: 利用配备TEE的物联网设备作为随机源，使用密码学工具聚合多个随机源生成最终随机数，用户可配置系统以容忍恶意参与者拒绝响应。

Result: 新方法只需一个诚实随机源即可保证无偏性，提供了具体构造进一步降低链上计算复杂度，评估了计算和gas成本证明了改进的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的混合随机数生成解决方案能够有效缓解现有方法的局限性，为dApp提供可靠且成本效益高的随机数生成框架。

Abstract: Random numbers play a vital role in many decentralized applications (dApps),
such as gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.
  Existing random number provision mechanisms can be roughly divided into two
categories, on-chain, and off-chain.
  On-chain approaches usually rely on the blockchain as the major input and all
computations are done by blockchain nodes.
  The major risk for this type of method is that the input itself is
susceptible to the adversary's influence.
  Off-chain approaches, as the name suggested, complete the generation without
the involvement of blockchain nodes and share the result directly with a dApp.
  These mechanisms usually have a strong security assumption and high
complexity.
  To mitigate these limitations and provide a framework that allows a dApp to
balance different factors involved in random number generation, we propose a
hybrid random number generation solution that leverages IoT devices equipped
with trusted execution environment (TEE) as the randomness sources, and then
utilizes a set of cryptographic tools to aggregate the multiple sources and
obtain the final random number that can be consumed by the dApp.
  The new approach only needs one honest random source to guarantee the
unbiasedness of the final random number and a user can configure the system to
tolerate malicious participants who can refuse to respond to avoid unfavored
results.
  We also provide a concrete construction that can further reduce the on-chain
computation complexity to lower the cost of the solution in practice.
  We evaluate the computation and gas costs to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the improvement.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Kun-IE是一个新颖的图像加密框架，通过2D Sin-Cos Pi超混沌映射和Kun-SCAN置换策略，解决了现有混沌加密方法在置换扩散和伪随机性方面的不足，支持任意尺寸图像加密。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于混沌的图像加密方法存在置换扩散不足、伪随机特性欠佳等漏洞，需要开发更安全可靠的加密方案。

Method: 开发了2D Sin-Cos Pi超混沌映射(2D-SCPHM)提供更宽的混沌范围和更好的伪随机序列生成，并引入Kun-SCAN置换策略显著降低像素相关性。

Result: 实验结果表明Kun-IE对各种密码分析攻击具有鲁棒性，是安全图像通信的强有力解决方案。

Conclusion: Kun-IE框架通过创新的超混沌映射和置换策略，有效提升了图像加密的安全性，适用于任意尺寸图像的加密需求。

Abstract: Chaotic systems play a key role in modern image encryption due to their
sensitivity to initial conditions, ergodicity, and complex dynamics. However,
many existing chaos-based encryption methods suffer from vulnerabilities, such
as inadequate permutation and diffusion, and suboptimal pseudorandom
properties. This paper presents Kun-IE, a novel encryption framework designed
to address these issues. The framework features two key contributions: the
development of the 2D Sin-Cos Pi Hyperchaotic Map (2D-SCPHM), which offers a
broader chaotic range and superior pseudorandom sequence generation, and the
introduction of Kun-SCAN, a novel permutation strategy that significantly
reduces pixel correlations, enhancing resistance to statistical attacks. Kun-IE
is flexible and supports encryption for images of any size. Experimental
results and security analyses demonstrate its robustness against various
cryptanalytic attacks, making it a strong solution for secure image
communication. The code is available at this

### [10] [Locket: Robust Feature-Locking Technique for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12117)
*Lipeng He,Vasisht Duddu,N. Asokan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Locket是首个稳健且可扩展的特征锁定技术，通过将适配器附加到LLM来拒绝未授权特征，支持按需付费解锁方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 聊天机器人提供商需要更细粒度的付费解锁方案来增加收入，但现有特征锁定技术不够稳健或可扩展。

Method: 使用新颖的合并方法将适配器附加到LLM上，以拒绝未授权特征。

Result: Locket在锁定特征上100%拒绝，解锁特征效用损失≤7%，攻击成功率≤5%，可扩展到多特征和多用户。

Conclusion: Locket是首个满足所有要求的稳健可扩展特征锁定技术，支持经济可行的付费解锁商业模式。

Abstract: Chatbot providers (e.g., OpenAI) rely on tiered subscription schemes to
generate revenue, offering basic models for free users, and advanced models for
paying subscribers. However, a finer-grained pay-to-unlock scheme for premium
features (e.g., math, coding) is thought to be more economically viable for the
providers. Such a scheme requires a feature-locking technique (FLoTE) which is
(i) effective in refusing locked features, (ii) utility-preserving for unlocked
features, (iii) robust against evasion or unauthorized credential sharing, and
(iv) scalable to multiple features and users. However, existing FLoTEs (e.g.,
password-locked models) are not robust or scalable. We present Locket, the
first robust and scalable FLoTE to enable pay-to-unlock schemes. Locket uses a
novel merging approach to attach adapters to an LLM for refusing unauthorized
features. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that Locket is effective ($100$%
refusal on locked features), utility-preserving ($\leq 7$% utility degradation
in unlocked features), robust ($\leq 5$% attack success rate), and scales to
multiple features and clients.

### [11] [VeilAudit: Breaking the Deadlock Between Privacy and Accountability Across Blockchains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12153)
*Minhao Qiao,Iqbal Gondal,Hai Dong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: VeilAudit是一个跨链审计框架，通过审计师可链接性在保护用户隐私的同时实现监管问责，平衡了区块链互操作性中的隐私与合规需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决区块链跨链互操作性中用户隐私与监管问责之间的根本矛盾，现有解决方案要么完全匿名要么强制身份披露，限制了在受监管金融环境中的采用。

Method: 使用用户生成的链接审计标签，包含零知识证明验证有效性而不暴露用户主钱包地址，以及只有指定审计师能测试链接的特殊密文；支持在正当程序下的阈值门控身份揭示。

Result: 开发了跨多个EVM链的原型，评估表明该框架在当前多链环境中具有实用性。

Conclusion: VeilAudit框架在保护用户隐私的同时实现了监管问责，为受监管的区块链应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross chain interoperability in blockchain systems exposes a fundamental
tension between user privacy and regulatory accountability. Existing solutions
enforce an all or nothing choice between full anonymity and mandatory identity
disclosure, which limits adoption in regulated financial settings. We present
VeilAudit, a cross chain auditing framework that introduces Auditor Only
Linkability, which allows auditors to link transaction behaviors that originate
from the same anonymous entity without learning its identity. VeilAudit
achieves this with a user generated Linkable Audit Tag that embeds a zero
knowledge proof to attest to its validity without exposing the user master
wallet address, and with a special ciphertext that only designated auditors can
test for linkage. To balance privacy and compliance, VeilAudit also supports
threshold gated identity revelation under due process. VeilAudit further
provides a mechanism for building reputation in pseudonymous environments,
which enables applications such as cross chain credit scoring based on
verifiable behavioral history. We formalize the security guarantees and develop
a prototype that spans multiple EVM chains. Our evaluation shows that the
framework is practical for today multichain environments.

### [12] [Leaking Queries On Secure Stream Processing Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12172)
*Hung Pham,Viet Vo,Tien Tuan Anh Dinh,Duc Tran,Shuhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文展示了从使用Intel SGX保护执行引擎的流处理系统中提取查询的可行性，攻击基于时序侧信道，成功率高达92%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流处理系统在现代应用中至关重要，但云环境被视为不可信。现有工作主要关注数据保护，而查询同样敏感，因为它们包含应用逻辑。

Method: 攻击分为两个阶段：离线阶段基于合成数据分析单个流操作符的执行时间并建立识别模型；在线阶段隔离查询中的操作符，监控执行并利用模型恢复操作符。

Result: 基于SecureStream和NEXMark流行数据流基准测试实现攻击，攻击成功率高达92%。

Conclusion: 讨论了在不产生高开销的情况下加固流处理系统以抵御此类攻击的方法。

Abstract: Stream processing systems are important in modern applications in which data
arrive continuously and need to be processed in real time. Because of their
resource and scalability requirements, many of these systems run on the cloud,
which is considered untrusted. Existing works on securing databases on the
cloud focus on protecting the data, and most systems leverage trusted hardware
for high performance. However, in stream processing systems, queries are as
sensitive as the data because they contain the application logics.
  We demonstrate that it is practical to extract the queries from stream
processing systems that use Intel SGX for securing the execution engine. The
attack performed by a malicious cloud provider is based on timing side
channels, and it works in two phases. In the offline phase, the attacker
profiles the execution time of individual stream operators, based on synthetic
data. This phase outputs a model that identifies individual stream operators.
In the online phase, the attacker isolates the operators that make up the
query, monitors its execution, and recovers the operators using the model in
the previous phase. We implement the attack based on popular data stream
benchmarks using SecureStream and NEXMark, and demonstrate attack success rates
of up to 92%. We further discuss approaches that can harden streaming
processing systems against our attacks without incurring high overhead.

*Yuqi Jia,Yupei Liu,Zedian Shao,Jinyuan Jia,Neil Gong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PromptLocate是首个用于定位提示注入攻击中注入提示的方法，通过三个步骤在受污染数据中准确定位注入指令和数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提示注入攻击通过污染输入数据欺骗大语言模型执行攻击者指定的任务而非预期任务，定位注入提示对于攻击后取证分析和数据恢复至关重要，但目前该领域仍未被充分探索。

Method: PromptLocate包含三个步骤：(1)将受污染数据分割成语义连贯的片段，(2)识别被注入指令污染的片段，(3)定位被注入数据污染的片段。

Result: PromptLocate在8个现有攻击和8个自适应攻击中都能准确定位注入提示。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了提示注入定位领域的空白，为后攻击分析和数据恢复提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks deceive a large language model into completing an
attacker-specified task instead of its intended task by contaminating its input
data with an injected prompt, which consists of injected instruction(s) and
data. Localizing the injected prompt within contaminated data is crucial for
post-attack forensic analysis and data recovery. Despite its growing
importance, prompt injection localization remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we bridge this gap by proposing PromptLocate, the first method for
localizing injected prompts. PromptLocate comprises three steps: (1) splitting
the contaminated data into semantically coherent segments, (2) identifying
segments contaminated by injected instructions, and (3) pinpointing segments
contaminated by injected data. We show PromptLocate accurately localizes
injected prompts across eight existing and eight adaptive attacks.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出在隐空间中执行隐写分析，通过建模隐向量范数的统计分布来检测基于隐扩散模型的隐写方案。研究发现隐写后的隐向量分布在超球面上，而原始向量是独立同分布的高斯分布，基于此推导出似然比检验方法进行隐写分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐写方案在隐空间中修改种子向量嵌入信息，而大多数隐写分析方法在图像空间中检测嵌入。本文旨在通过在隐空间中建模隐向量的统计分布来改进隐写分析效果。

Method: 分析隐向量范数在隐写前后的统计分布差异，将隐写后的隐向量建模为分布在超球面上，原始向量为i.i.d.高斯分布。基于此推导似然比检验进行隐写分析，并研究提示词和扩散步数的影响。

Result: 证明在隐空间中可以检测Hu等人提出的隐写方案，该方案在图像空间中几乎不可检测。通过建模隐向量范数的高斯分布方差差异，实现了有效的隐写分析。

Conclusion: 在隐空间中进行隐写分析比图像空间更有效，通过随机采样隐向量范数可以使原始隐写方案在隐空间中不可检测。

Abstract: Steganographic schemes dedicated to generated images modify the seed vector
in the latent space to embed a message, whereas most steganalysis methods
attempt to detect the embedding in the image space. This paper proposes to
perform steganalysis in the latent space by modeling the statistical
distribution of the norm of the latent vector. Specifically, we analyze the
practical security of a scheme proposed by Hu et. al. for latent diffusion
models, which is both robust and practically undetectable when steganalysis is
performed on generated images. We show that after embedding, the Stego (latent)
vector is distributed on a hypersphere while the Cover vector is i.i.d.
Gaussian. By going from the image space to the latent space, we show that it is
possible to model the norm of the vector in the latent space under the Cover or
Stego hypothesis as Gaussian distributions with different variances. A
Likelihood Ratio Test is then derived to perform pooled steganalysis. The
impact of the potential knowledge of the prompt and the number of diffusion
steps, is also studied. Additionally, we also show how, by randomly sampling
the norm of the latent vector before generation, the initial Stego scheme
becomes undetectable in the latent space.

*Ayush Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于上下文感知安全验证的形式化框架，为ML增强的自适应系统建立可证明的安全保证。引入了上下文完整性这一新安全属性，并证明了样本复杂度界限、信息理论限制、ML负载生成器的收敛保证以及组合健全性界限。通过实验验证了理论预测，展示了自适应验证相比静态方法的可证明改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态验证方法在ML增强的自适应系统中存在局限性，无法有效处理动态上下文变化。需要建立形式化框架来为自适应系统提供可证明的安全保证，并明确区分静态上下文无关验证器与上下文感知自适应验证器的能力差异。

Method: 引入上下文完整性作为新的安全属性，建立形式化框架分析样本复杂度界限、信息理论限制、ML负载生成器的收敛特性以及组合健全性。通过理论证明和实验验证相结合的方法，在97,224个漏洞样本上进行受控实验。

Result: 实验结果显示：检测准确率从58%提升到69.93%（随数据集增长），成功概率从51%增加到82%（随上下文丰富），训练损失以O(1/sqrt(T))速率收敛，误报率10.19%在理论界限12%内。证明了上下文感知自适应验证器在自然目标族中优于任何有限负载预算的静态验证器。

Conclusion: 理论基础的适应性验证在特定假设下实现了对静态方法的可证明改进，同时保持了健全性保证。上下文感知方法在安全验证中具有显著优势，特别是在处理动态和自适应系统时。

Abstract: We present a formal framework for context-aware security verification that
establishes provable guarantees for ML-enhanced adaptive systems. We introduce
context-completeness - a new security property - and prove: (1) sample
complexity bounds showing when adaptive verification succeeds, (2)
information-theoretic limits relating context richness to detection capability,
(3) convergence guarantees for ML-based payload generators, and (4)
compositional soundness bounds. We further provide a formal separation between
static context-blind verifiers and context-aware adaptive verifiers: for a
natural family of targets, any static verifier with finite payload budget
achieves completeness at most alpha, while a context-aware verifier with
sufficient information achieves completeness greater than alpha. We validate
our theoretical predictions through controlled experiments on 97,224 exploit
samples, demonstrating: detection accuracy improving from 58% to 69.93% with
dataset growth, success probability increasing from 51% to 82% with context
enrichment, training loss converging at O(1/sqrt(T)) rate, and false positive
rate (10.19%) within theoretical bounds (12%). Our results show that
theoretically-grounded adaptive verification achieves provable improvements
over static approaches under stated assumptions while maintaining soundness
guarantees.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FlexPipe是一个动态重新配置LLM服务流水线架构的系统，通过细粒度模型划分、运行时流水线重构和拓扑感知资源分配，显著提升资源效率和降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM服务系统采用静态流水线配置，难以适应动态工作负载变化和服务器集群中的严重资源碎片化问题，导致效率低下。

Method: 将模型分解为细粒度阶段，基于实时请求模式分析智能调整流水线粒度，实现三个关键创新：保持计算图约束的细粒度模型划分、一致缓存转换的运行时流水线重构、以及导航GPU碎片化的拓扑感知资源分配。

Result: 在82-GPU集群上的综合评估显示，FlexPipe实现了高达8.5倍的资源效率提升，同时保持比最先进系统低38.3%的延迟，将GPU预留需求从峰值容量的75%降低到30%。

Conclusion: FlexPipe通过动态流水线重构有效解决了LLM服务中的资源效率问题，显著降低了GPU资源需求并提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) in production faces significant
challenges from highly variable request patterns and severe resource
fragmentation in serverless clusters. Current systems rely on static pipeline
configurations that struggle to adapt to dynamic workload conditions, leading
to substantial inefficiencies. We present FlexPipe, a novel system that
dynamically reconfigures pipeline architectures during runtime to address these
fundamental limitations. FlexPipe decomposes models into fine-grained stages
and intelligently adjusts pipeline granularity based on real-time request
pattern analysis, implementing three key innovations: fine-grained model
partitioning with preserved computational graph constraints, inflight pipeline
refactoring with consistent cache transitions, and topology-aware resource
allocation that navigates GPU fragmentation. Comprehensive evaluation on an
82-GPU cluster demonstrates that FlexPipe achieves up to 8.5x better resource
efficiency while maintaining 38.3% lower latency compared to state-of-the-art
systems, reducing GPU reservation requirements from 75% to 30% of peak
capacity.

guidance in setting up, running, and analyzing node-to-node scaling studies. We
propose templates for presenting scaling results of these studies and provide
several case studies highlighting the benefits of this approach.

TL;DR: 提出两种GPU加速的进程映射算法：基于层次多切分的方法和集成到多级图划分流水线的方法，相比CPU算法获得超过300倍的加速比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受GPU图划分器成功的启发，为超级计算机中的进程映射问题开发GPU加速算法，以平衡计算负载并最小化通信成本。

Method: 第一种方法采用层次多切分，沿超级计算机层次结构划分任务图；第二种方法将进程映射直接集成到现代多级图划分流水线中，利用GPU并行性加速关键阶段。

Result: 两种方法相比最先进的CPU算法获得超过300倍的加速比。第一种方法通信成本平均增加约10%，第二种方法几何平均加速比为77.6，峰值加速比598，但解质量较低。

Conclusion: 这是首个基于GPU的进程映射算法，在保持竞争力的同时实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Process mapping asks to assign vertices of a task graph to processing
elements of a supercomputer such that the computational workload is balanced
while the communication cost is minimized. Motivated by the recent success of
GPU-based graph partitioners, we propose two GPU-accelerated algorithms for
this optimization problem. The first algorithm employs hierarchical
multisection, which partitions the task graph alongside the hierarchy of the
supercomputer. The method utilizes GPU-based graph partitioners to accelerate
the mapping process. The second algorithm integrates process mapping directly
into the modern multilevel graph partitioning pipeline. Vital phases like
coarsening and refinement are accelerated by exploiting the parallelism of
GPUs. In our experiments, both methods achieve speedups exceeding 300 when
compared to state-of-the-art CPU-based algorithms. The first algorithm has, on
average, about 10 percent greater communication costs and thus remains
competitive to CPU algorithms. The second approach is much faster, with a
geometric mean speedup of 77.6 and peak speedup of 598 at the cost of lower
solution quality. To our knowledge, these are the first GPU-based algorithms
for process mapping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦环境中构建消费者特定的数据共享管道时，传统云设计模式的预定义和嵌入会损害模块化、降低可重用性，并与管道的动态消费者驱动特性相冲突。

Method: 开发基于Kubernetes的工具，支持自动化模式注入，允许延迟和非侵入式地应用选定的云设计模式，无需修改服务源代码，并收集能耗指标。

Result: 该工具能够在保持可重用数据共享管道灵活、可组合结构的同时，实现云设计模式的应用，并支持开发者进行能源感知决策。

Conclusion: 提出的方法解决了在模块化数据共享管道中集成云设计模式的挑战，既保持了管道的灵活性，又实现了能源效率的优化。

Abstract: As data mesh architectures gain traction in federated environments,
organizations are increasingly building consumer-specific data-sharing
pipelines using modular, cloud-native transformation services. Prior work has
shown that structuring these pipelines with reusable transformation stages
enhances both scalability and energy efficiency. However, integrating
traditional cloud design patterns into such pipelines poses a challenge:
predefining and embedding patterns can compromise modularity, reduce
reusability, and conflict with the pipelines dynamic, consumer-driven nature.
To address this, we introduce a Kubernetes-based tool that enables the deferred
and non-intrusive application of selected cloud design patterns without
requiring changes to service source code. The tool supports automated pattern
injection and collects energy consumption metrics, allowing developers to make
energy-aware decisions while preserving the flexible, composable structure of
reusable data-sharing pipelines.

Motivation: HPC代码开发中需要及早发现性能退化，并深入了解应用扩展行为，但现有工具在开销和后处理方面存在限制。

Method: 基于TALP工具实时收集性能指标，使用适合CI的文件夹结构存储数据，自动生成包含性能因子回归可视化和扩展效率表的HTML报告。

Conclusion: TALP-Pages提供了一个轻量级、高效的性能监控解决方案，易于集成到现有CI流程中，能够有效支持HPC代码的性能优化工作。

Abstract: Ensuring good performance is a key aspect in the development of codes that
target HPC machines. As these codes are under active development, the necessity
to detect performance degradation early in the development process becomes
apparent. In addition, having meaningful insight into application scaling
behavior tightly coupled to the development workflow is helpful. In this paper,
we introduce TALP-Pages, an easy-to-integrate framework that enables developers
to get fast and in-repository feedback about their code performance using
established fundamental performance and scaling factors. The framework relies
on TALP, which enables the on-the-fly collection of these metrics. Based on a
folder structure suited for CI which contains the files generated by TALP,
TALP-Pages generates an HTML report with visualizations of the performance
factor regression as well as scaling-efficiency tables. We compare TALP-Pages
to tracing-based tools in terms of overhead and post-processing requirements
and find that TALP-Pages can produce the scaling-efficiency tables faster and
under tighter resource constraints. To showcase the ease of use and
effectiveness of this approach, we extend the current CI setup of GENE-X with
only minimal changes required and showcase the ability to detect and explain a
performance improvement.

TL;DR: nuGPR是一个新的高斯过程回归框架，通过数值线性代数技术显著降低训练计算成本，包括使用预处理共轭梯度法、数据聚类识别协方差矩阵块对角结构、数值梯度优化超参数，并在GPU上并行化，相比现有最佳GPU实现减少2倍训练时间和12倍峰值内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高斯过程回归训练计算成本高的问题，特别是在大规模数据集上的应用限制。

Method: 结合预处理共轭梯度法加速线性求解、利用数据聚类识别协方差矩阵块对角结构并构建低秩近似、使用数值梯度优化超参数避免反向传播、利用CUDA Toolkit在GPU上并行化训练。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，相比现有最佳GPU实现，总训练时间减少最多2倍，峰值内存消耗减少最多12倍。

Conclusion: nuGPR框架通过数值线性代数技术和GPU并行化，有效解决了GPR训练的高计算成本问题，为大规模应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is an important type of supervised machine
learning model with inherent uncertainty measure in its predictions. We propose
a new framework, nuGPR, to address the well-known challenge of high computation
cost associated with GPR training. Our framework includes several ideas from
numerical linear algebra to reduce the amount of computation in key steps of
GPR, and we combine them to establish an end-to-end training algorithm.
Specifically, we leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to
accelerate the convergence of the linear solves required in GPR. We exploit
clustering in the input data to identify block-diagonal structure of the
covariance matrix and subsequently construct low-rank approximations of the
off-diagonal blocks. These enhancements significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of our computations. In addition, unlike other frameworks that rely
on exact differentiation, we employ numerical gradients to optimize the
hyperparameters of our GPR model, further reducing the training cost by
eliminating the need for backpropagation. Lastly, we leverage the CUDA Toolkit
to efficiently parallelize the training procedure on NVIDIA GPUs. As a result,
nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up
to 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets when compared to the best
existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出PubSub-VFL，一种基于发布/订阅架构的垂直联邦学习新范式，通过分层异步机制解决传统VFL训练延迟高、资源利用率低的问题，在保持准确性的同时实现2-7倍训练加速和高达91.07%的资源利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字经济发展，组织间数据协作需求增长，但隐私问题使直接数据共享不可行。垂直联邦学习(VFL)虽然提供了安全协作方案，但其同步依赖设计导致训练延迟高，参与方资源和数据异构性进一步降低计算效率。

Method: 采用发布/订阅架构，结合参数服务器架构的数据并行性，设计分层异步机制；基于参与方系统配置文件形式化优化问题，选择最优超参数同时保护隐私；理论分析证明稳定收敛性和与差分隐私等安全协议的兼容性。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛案例研究表明，与最先进基线相比，PubSub-VFL在不影响准确性的情况下将训练速度提升2-7倍，计算资源利用率高达91.07%。

Conclusion: PubSub-VFL通过创新的发布/订阅架构有效解决了VFL中的训练效率和资源利用问题，为安全高效的跨组织数据协作提供了可行方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between
organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth
of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing
impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure
collaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers
from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency.
Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency,
while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder
efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a
novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for
two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL
leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data
parallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical
asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system
efficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource
and data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on
participants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal
hyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to
demonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible with
security protocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five
benchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared
to state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2
\sim 7\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational
resource utilization rate of up to 91.07%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL框架的可扩展性受限，RL轨迹生成中的极端长尾偏斜导致严重的GPU利用率低下，而当前的异步RL系统依赖于全局权重同步，无法适应RL训练中高度偏斜和演化的轨迹生成延迟分布。

Method: 提出Laminar系统：1）用中继工作者层替代全局更新，实现异步细粒度权重同步；2）动态重新打包机制将长尾轨迹整合到专用rollout上；3）完全解耦设计隔离故障。

Result: 在1024-GPU集群上的评估显示，Laminar相比最先进系统实现了高达5.48倍的训练吞吐量加速，同时减少了模型收敛时间。

Conclusion: 通过轨迹级异步和完全解耦架构，Laminar能够高效扩展RL后训练，显著提升训练效率和系统鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) is
now scaling to large clusters and running for extended durations to enhance
model reasoning performance. However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks
is limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes
severe GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to
mitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor
and all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global
synchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution
of trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency.
Our key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep
through trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each
trajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL
post-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace
global updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter
service. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization,
allowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the
actor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates
long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation
throughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring
robustness for long-running jobs. Our evaluation on a 1024-GPU cluster shows
that Laminar achieves up to 5.48$\times$ training throughput speedup over
state-of-the-art systems, while reducing model convergence time.

Conclusion: 分层联邦学习在农业场景中具有显著优势，特别适用于异构农场环境和隐私敏感数据的情况。

Abstract: In this paper, we presents a novel hierarchical federated learning
architecture specifically designed for smart agricultural production systems
and crop yield prediction. Our approach introduces a seasonal subscription
mechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the beginning of each
agricultural season. The proposed three-layer architecture consists of
individual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the
middle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop
cluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific
crop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model
that integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design
enables both local specialization for individual crop types and global
generalization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data
privacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models
closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly
outperforming standard machine learning models. The results validate the
advantages of hierarchical federated learning in the agricultural context,
particularly for scenarios involving heterogeneous farming environments and
privacy-sensitive agricultural data.

TL;DR: ProtoDoctor是一个ICU死亡率预测框架，通过原型学习实现内在可解释性，整合了临床病程识别、人口异质性和预后意识三个ICU决策实践要素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU死亡率预测不仅需要预测准确性，还需要可解释性来建立临床信任和满足监管标准。现有方法主要关注人口异质性，忽略了临床病程识别和预后意识。

Method: 提出ProtoDoctor框架，包含预后临床病程识别模块（通过原型学习识别临床病程，使用新正则化机制实现预后意识）和人口异质性识别模块（通过队列特定原型和风险调整建模人口异质性）。

Result: 广泛的实证评估表明ProtoDoctor在预测准确性上优于最先进的基线方法。人工评估进一步证实其解释在临床上更有意义、更可信且更适用于ICU实践。

Conclusion: ProtoDoctor成功整合了ICU决策实践的三个关键要素，在保持高预测准确性的同时提供了临床上有意义的解释，为ICU死亡率预测提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality prediction, which estimates a patient's
mortality status at discharge using EHRs collected early in an ICU admission,
is vital in critical care. For this task, predictive accuracy alone is
insufficient; interpretability is equally essential for building clinical trust
and meeting regulatory standards, a topic that has attracted significant
attention in information system research. Accordingly, an ideal solution should
enable intrinsic interpretability and align its reasoning with three key
elements of the ICU decision-making practices: clinical course identification,
demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness. However, conventional
approaches largely focus on demographic heterogeneity, overlooking clinical
course identification and prognostication awareness. Recent prototype learning
methods address clinical course identification, yet the integration of the
other elements into such frameworks remains underexplored. To address these
gaps, we propose ProtoDoctor, a novel ICU mortality prediction framework that
delivers intrinsic interpretability while integrating all three elements of the
ICU decision-making practices into its reasoning process. Methodologically,
ProtoDoctor features two key innovations: the Prognostic Clinical Course
Identification module and the Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module. The
former enables the identification of clinical courses via prototype learning
and achieves prognostication awareness using a novel regularization mechanism.
The latter models demographic heterogeneity through cohort-specific prototypes
and risk adjustments. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
ProtoDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.
Human evaluations further confirm that its interpretations are more clinically
meaningful, trustworthy, and applicable in ICU practice.

Method: 提出GAR框架，在可验证环境中联合训练问题生成器和求解器，通过对抗循环实现隐式课程学习，使任务难度与证明者能力同步提升。

Result: 在MiniF2F-Test基准上平均相对提升4.20%，在ProofNet-Test上pass@32从22.58%提升至25.81%。

Conclusion: GAR不仅提升了定理证明性能，还建立了问题生成与求解协同进化的一般性RL范式。

Abstract: Solving math problems through verifiable languages such as Lean has
significantly impacted both the mathematics and computer science communities.
Current state-of-the-art models are often trained with expensive online
Reinforcement Learning (RL) or expert iteration. However, these approaches rely
on fixed problem sets, which causes inefficient training and limits the model
to tackle complex problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose GAR:
Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning, a comprehensive RL training
framework that jointly trains the problem composer and solver in an adversarial
loop. GAR introduces an implicit curriculum learning mechanism, which aligns
task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability. It thereby improves the
training efficiency and enables stronger performance of proving advanced
theorems. Experiments show that with GAR training, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve an average relative improvement in pass@32 of
4.20% on MiniF2F-Test benchmark, while DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on
ProofNet-Test increases from 22.58% to 25.81%. Beyond formal proving, GAR
establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and
solving under verifiable environments.

Motivation: 经典薛定谔桥问题在实践应用中存在不稳定性，特别是在高维或数据稀缺情况下。为了解决这一挑战，作者引入了软约束方法。

Method: 采用软约束薛定谔桥问题框架，将硬终端约束替换为一般惩罚函数，建立更灵活的McKean-Vlasov型随机控制公式。

Result: 证明了所有惩罚水平下最优解的存在性，并证明随着惩罚增加，控制和价值函数以线性速率收敛到经典薛定谔桥问题的解。

Conclusion: 软约束方法不仅为软约束桥提供了首个定量收敛保证，还揭示了惩罚正则化如何实现鲁棒的生成建模、微调和迁移学习。

Abstract: Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps
simple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently
found a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge
problems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between
prescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the
classical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to
instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or
data-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the
so-called soft-constrained Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the
terminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation
leads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.
  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and
prove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions
converge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on
Doob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\"odinger
potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an
optimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic
optimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first
quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed
light on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling,
fine-tuning, and transfer learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的零阶近似方法，用于估计训练数据对模型预测行为的影响，特别适用于大型模型，仅需损失值和检查点即可计算，无需梯度或逆Hessian矩阵。

Method: 基于损失值和模型检查点的零阶近似方法，仅需训练和测试数据的中间检查点损失值，不依赖梯度或逆Hessian计算，适用于非可微损失函数。

Result: 该方法在计算效率上显著优于现有方法，在自影响估计上达到更高精度，在训练-测试影响估计上达到相当或更好的精度，特别适用于微调后的大型语言模型。

Conclusion: 提出的零阶近似方法为大规模机器学习系统提供了可扩展且实用的训练数据分析工具，能够有效理解训练数据如何塑造模型行为。

Abstract: A critical aspect of analyzing and improving modern machine learning systems
lies in understanding how individual training examples influence a model's
predictive behavior. Estimating this influence enables critical applications,
including data selection and model debugging; in particular, self-influence,
which quantifies the influence of a training point on itself, has found many
uses in data quality assessment and outlier detection. Existing methods for
measuring data influence, however, are often impractical for large models due
to low accuracy or prohibitive computational costs: most approaches either
provide poor approximations or rely on gradients and inverse-Hessian
computations that remain challenging to scale. In this work, we introduce a
highly efficient zeroth-order approximation for estimating the influence of
training data that requires only a fraction of the time and memory footprint of
prior methods. Notably, our method relies solely on loss values of intermediate
checkpoints on the training and test data, along with the checkpoints
themselves, making it broadly applicable even when the loss function of
interest is non-differentiable. Beyond its computational efficiency, our
approach achieves superior accuracy in estimating self-influence and comparable
or improved accuracy in estimating train-test influence for fine-tuned large
language models, enabling scalable and practical analysis of how training data
shapes model behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为边界引导的强化学习微调方法，通过明确引导生成远离分类器的决策边界，来改善生成模型的安全性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过微调生成器来降低被安全分类器过滤的概率，但这种方法往往使模型产生靠近分类器决策边界的样本，增加了假阳性和假阴性。

Method: 使用强化学习微调方法，明确引导生成远离分类器的边界，而不是简单地减少被过滤的概率。

Result: 在越狱和模糊提示的基准测试中，边界引导方法通过LLM-as-a-Judge评估显示，输出的安全性和实用性都得到了改善。

Conclusion: 边界引导方法在模型规模和奖励设计方面的综合消融实验证明了该方法的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter
harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator
to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it
often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision
boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose
Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly
steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of
jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and
the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive
ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of
our approach.

TL;DR: WaveletDiff是一种新颖的扩散模型框架，通过在小波系数上直接训练来利用时间序列数据的多分辨率结构，在多个真实数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型高质量时间序列数据集稀缺，现有生成模型局限于时域或频域，难以再现真实世界时间序列固有的多尺度结构。

Method: 在小波系数上训练扩散模型，结合每层分解的专用变压器和跨层注意力机制，通过自适应门控实现时频尺度间的选择性信息交换，并基于Parseval定理加入能量保持约束。

Result: 在能源、金融和神经科学领域的六个真实数据集上，WaveletDiff在五个不同性能指标上始终优于最先进的时域和频域生成方法，判别分数和Context-FID分数平均比次优基线小3倍。

Conclusion: WaveletDiff通过在小波域中建模，有效捕捉时间序列的多尺度特性，在合成生成任务中表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous in many applications that involve forecasting,
classification and causal inference tasks, such as healthcare, finance, audio
signal processing and climate sciences. Still, large, high-quality time series
datasets remain scarce. Synthetic generation can address this limitation;
however, current models confined either to the time or frequency domains
struggle to reproduce the inherently multi-scaled structure of real-world time
series. We introduce WaveletDiff, a novel framework that trains diffusion
models directly on wavelet coefficients to exploit the inherent
multi-resolution structure of time series data. The model combines dedicated
transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms
that enable selective information exchange between temporal and frequency
scales through adaptive gating. It also incorporates energy preservation
constraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve
spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across
six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains
demonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time
series across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff
achieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\times$
smaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets.

Conclusion: 提供了基于实证的回放比例选择指南，使实践者能够在减少训练成本的同时实现强大的任务适应能力。

Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a
fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied
synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing
task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain
poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the
interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when
adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our
target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically
evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We
analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our
experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific
performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide
empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on
computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation
with significantly reduced training costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源视觉语言模型的进展为理解复杂多模态现象（如讽刺）提供了新机会，需要评估这些模型在检测多模态讽刺和生成解释方面的能力。

Method: 使用零样本、单样本和少样本提示，在三个基准讽刺数据集（Muse、MMSD2.0和SarcNet）上评估7种最先进VLMs（BLIP2、InstructBLIP、OpenFlamingo、LLaVA、PaliGemma、Gemma3和Qwen-VL）。

Result: 当前模型在二元讽刺检测方面取得中等成功，但在没有任务特定微调的情况下无法生成高质量的解释。

Conclusion: 虽然现有视觉语言模型在多模态讽刺检测方面有一定能力，但在生成解释讽刺的视觉-文本不一致性方面仍需改进和专门优化。

Abstract: Recent advances in open-source vision-language models (VLMs) offer new
opportunities for understanding complex and subjective multimodal phenomena
such as sarcasm. In this work, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art VLMs - BLIP2,
InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, and Qwen-VL - on their
ability to detect multimodal sarcasm using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting.
Furthermore, we evaluate the models' capabilities in generating explanations to
sarcastic instances. We evaluate the capabilities of VLMs on three benchmark
sarcasm datasets (Muse, MMSD2.0, and SarcNet). Our primary objectives are
twofold: (1) to quantify each model's performance in detecting sarcastic
image-caption pairs, and (2) to assess their ability to generate human-quality
explanations that highlight the visual-textual incongruities driving sarcasm.
Our results indicate that, while current models achieve moderate success in
binary sarcasm detection, they are still not able to generate high-quality
explanations without task-specific finetuning.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了将参与者行为信息建模为时间序列是否能够提高吞吐时间预测模型的性能。通过构建包含吞吐时间和参与者行为特征的多变量时间序列，研究发现加入参与者行为的模型在RMSE、MAE和R2指标上均优于仅包含吞吐时间特征的基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测性过程监控是过程挖掘中的关键任务，旨在预测未来行为、结果或性能指标。由于过程通常是资源驱动的，理解和纳入参与者行为对预测至关重要。现有研究虽然纳入了参与者行为的某些方面，但其作为时变信号在预测性过程监控中的作用仍然有限。

Method: 使用真实事件日志构建多变量时间序列，包括吞吐时间以及参与者中心特征，如参与者参与度、继续、中断和交接行为的频率，以及这些行为的持续时间。训练和比较多个模型，研究添加参与者行为的好处。

Result: 结果显示，包含参与者行为的模型在RMSE、MAE和R2指标上持续优于仅包含吞吐时间特征的基线模型。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明，随时间建模参与者行为并将此信息纳入预测模型可以增强性能指标预测能力。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) is a key task in Process Mining that aims
to predict future behavior, outcomes, or performance indicators. Accurate
prediction of the latter is critical for proactive decision-making. Given that
processes are often resource-driven, understanding and incorporating actor
behavior in forecasting is crucial. Although existing research has incorporated
aspects of actor behavior, its role as a time-varying signal in PPM remains
limited. This study investigates whether incorporating actor behavior
information, modeled as time series, can improve the predictive performance of
throughput time (TT) forecasting models. Using real-life event logs, we
construct multivariate time series that include TT alongside actor-centric
features, i.e., actor involvement, the frequency of continuation, interruption,
and handover behaviors, and the duration of these behaviors. We train and
compare several models to study the benefits of adding actor behavior. The
results show that actor-enriched models consistently outperform baseline
models, which only include TT features, in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2. These
findings demonstrate that modeling actor behavior over time and incorporating
this information into forecasting models enhances performance indicator
predictions.

Motivation: 现有知识图嵌入方法大多基于封闭世界假设，将缺失三元组视为假，与现实世界的开放世界假设不符。显式负陈述有助于区分假三元组和未知三元组，但很少被包含在知识图中且在嵌入训练中被忽视。

Method: 采用双模型架构，并行训练两个嵌入模型：一个在正陈述上训练，另一个在负陈述上训练。每个模型通过破坏正样本并选择另一个模型评分最高的候选作为负样本。

Result: 在通用和领域特定知识图上的广泛实验表明，该方法在链接预测和三元组分类任务上优于最先进的嵌入模型。

Conclusion: 将有意义负知识整合到嵌入学习中能显著提升预测性能，验证了负知识在知识图嵌入中的价值。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the
backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link
prediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for
exploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and
relations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture
underlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on
assumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World
Assumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open
World Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore,
while explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false
and unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often
overlooked during embedding training.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly
declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our
approach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are
trained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative
statements. During training, each model generates negative samples by
corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored
by the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose
and domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and
triple classification tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding
models, demonstrating the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge
into embedding learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然保护隐私，但由于参与者对训练数据的独立性，容易受到投毒攻击。这种协作还会传播偏见，即使是无意的，也会因数据分布不同或历史偏见而加剧。

Method: 提出一种故意公平性攻击，恶意客户端在训练时增加公平性损失，通过解决公平性指标（如人口统计均等和均等化几率）的优化问题来计算公平性损失。

Result: 攻击效果显著，即使FL系统中只有一个恶意客户端，也能将偏见增加高达90%。攻击对最先进的拜占庭鲁棒和公平感知聚合方案在不同数据集和设置下都有效。

Conclusion: 这种攻击隐蔽且难以检测，因为它保持全局准确性，同时增加偏见，突显了联邦学习系统在公平性方面的脆弱性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique
that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL
enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL
provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes
susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among
the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or
historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional
fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing
the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data
distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization
problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The
attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even
after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different
datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack
efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90\%, even in the presence of a single
malicious client in the FL system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然变换器架构在序列建模中表现出色，并被用于顺序决策（如决策变换器DT），但其在对抗性强化学习中的鲁棒性尚未充分探索。本文旨在解决DT在对抗性随机游戏中的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 将每个阶段的交互建模为阶段博弈，支付函数定义为后续状态的期望最大值，显式包含随机状态转移。通过基于这些阶段博弈的NashQ值来条件化变换器策略，生成同时具有对抗鲁棒性和对转移不确定性保守的策略。

Result: 实证研究表明，CART在对抗性随机游戏中实现了更准确的极小极大值估计，并在各种对抗性环境中一致获得更优的最坏情况回报。

Conclusion: CART框架成功增强了决策变换器的对抗鲁棒性，通过将阶段博弈与变换器策略相结合，在对抗性随机游戏中表现出色，为序列建模在对抗性强化学习中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Transformer, a highly expressive architecture for sequence modeling, has
recently been adapted to solve sequential decision-making, most notably through
the Decision Transformer (DT), which learns policies by conditioning on desired
returns. Yet, the adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods
based on sequence modeling remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce the
Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART), to our knowledge
the first framework designed to enhance the robustness of DT in adversarial
stochastic games. We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the
adversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the
expected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating
stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ
value derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are
simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to
transition uncertainty. Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value
estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range
of adversarial stochastic games.

Motivation: 随着用户越来越多地使用私有信息与大型语言模型交互，安全加密通信变得至关重要。同态加密提供了直接对加密数据进行计算的解决方案，但文本生成（特别是下一个令牌预测）仍然是实际加密交互的关键障碍。

Method: 采用基于旅行商问题（TSP）的令牌重排序策略来处理加密文本生成的困难，并引入后续处理步骤进一步减少近似误差。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，该方法能够防止崩溃，提高生成文本的连贯性，并在整个过程中保持数据隐私。

Conclusion: 本文的贡献推进了实用且保护隐私的LLM推理的可行性。

Abstract: As users increasingly interact with large language models (LLMs) using
private information, secure and encrypted communication becomes essential.
Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a principled solution by enabling
computation directly on encrypted data. Although prior work has explored
aspects of running LLMs under HE, the challenge of text generation,
particularly next-token prediction, has received limited attention and remains
a key obstacle to practical encrypted interaction. In this work, we propose a
TSP-based token reordering strategy to address the difficulties of encrypted
text generation, together with a post-processing step that further reduces
approximation error. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
that our method prevents collapse, improves coherence in generated text, and
preserves data privacy throughout. Overall, our contributions advance the
feasibility of practical and privacy-preserving LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鲁棒强化学习方法依赖嵌套min-max优化，计算成本高且产生过于保守的策略，需要更高效且不过度保守的鲁棒性方法。

Method: 提出AdaRL双层优化框架：下层在固定秩约束下优化策略，从Wasserstein球中采样动态模型；上层自适应调整秩以平衡偏差-方差权衡，将策略参数投影到低秩流形上。

Result: 在MuJoCo连续控制基准测试中，AdaRL不仅持续优于固定秩基线（如SAC）和最先进的鲁棒RL方法（如RNAC、Parseval），还收敛到任务的内在秩。

Conclusion: 自适应低秩策略表示为模型不确定性下的鲁棒强化学习提供了高效且原则性的替代方案。

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (Robust RL) seeks to handle epistemic
uncertainty in environment dynamics, but existing approaches often rely on
nested min--max optimization, which is computationally expensive and yields
overly conservative policies. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Rank Representation
(AdaRL)}, a bi-level optimization framework that improves robustness by
aligning policy complexity with the intrinsic dimension of the task. At the
lower level, AdaRL performs policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints
with dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball around a centroid model. At the
upper level, it adaptively adjusts the rank to balance the bias--variance
trade-off, projecting policy parameters onto a low-rank manifold. This design
avoids solving adversarial worst-case dynamics while ensuring robustness
without over-parameterization. Empirical results on MuJoCo continuous control
benchmarks demonstrate that AdaRL not only consistently outperforms fixed-rank
baselines (e.g., SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (e.g., RNAC,
Parseval), but also converges toward the intrinsic rank of the underlying
tasks. These results highlight that adaptive low-rank policy representations
provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model
uncertainty.

Method: 引入包含个人和关系事件的公共数据集，提出统一的形式化方法，并实证研究同时包含两种事件类型的模型效果。

Result: 实证结果表明，同时包含两种事件类型的模型表现更好，但当前方法仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: 发布数据集和资源以支持统一用户事件建模的进一步研究，鼓励在该方向取得进展。

Abstract: User event modeling plays a central role in many machine learning
applications, with use cases spanning e-commerce, social media, finance,
cybersecurity, and other domains. User events can be broadly categorized into
personal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which
involve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically
modeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and
graph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both
event types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them
together. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior
can be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence
or a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and
prediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational
events. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a
unified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from
incorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods
leave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support
further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this
direction.

Motivation: 传统室内Wi-Fi定位方法对环境动态、信道传播特性和硬件异构性高度敏感，需要大量人工校准且性能在设备、信道或部署条件变化时迅速下降。

Method: 通过在不同Wi-Fi数据集上微调大型语言模型，Locaris学习从原始信号直接到设备位置的轻量级可泛化映射，将每个接入点测量视为标记。

Conclusion: 紧凑型LLM可作为室内定位的免校准回归模型，在异构Wi-Fi部署中提供可扩展和稳健的跨环境性能，特别适用于大规模部署场景。

Abstract: Indoor Wi-Fi positioning remains a challenging problem due to the high
sensitivity of radio signals to environmental dynamics, channel propagation
characteristics, and hardware heterogeneity. Conventional fingerprinting and
model-based approaches typically require labor-intensive calibration and suffer
rapid performance degradation when devices, channel or deployment conditions
change. In this paper, we introduce Locaris, a decoder-only large language
model (LLM) for indoor localization. Locaris treats each access point (AP)
measurement as a token, enabling the ingestion of raw Wi-Fi telemetry without
pre-processing. By fine-tuning its LLM on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris
learns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to
device location. Our experimental study comparing Locaris with state-of-the-art
methods consistently shows that Locaris matches or surpasses existing
techniques for various types of telemetry. Our results demonstrate that compact
LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization,
offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous
Wi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments, using only a handful of
calibration points per device, further show that Locaris maintains high
accuracy when applied to previously unseen devices and deployment scenarios.
This yields sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, robust
performance under missing APs and supports any and all available telemetry. Our
findings highlight the practical viability of Locaris for indoor positioning in
the real-world scenarios, particularly in large-scale deployments where
extensive calibration is infeasible.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对Mao等人(2022)的RestartQ-UCB算法存在的两个核心问题：完全遗忘（重启后丢失所有环境信息）和预定重启（不考虑策略与当前环境动态的不兼容性），需要设计更高效的重启机制。

Method: 提出了三种重启方法：部分重启、自适应重启和选择性重启，用于改进RestartQ-UCB和RANDOMIZEDQ算法。

Result: 在多种不同环境中实现了接近最优的实证性能，相对于RestartQ-UCB将动态遗憾降低了高达91%。

Conclusion: 提出的三种重启范式有效解决了非平稳强化学习中的重启设计问题，显著提升了算法性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose three efficient restart paradigms for model-free
non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL). We identify two core issues with
the restart design of Mao et al. (2022)'s RestartQ-UCB algorithm: (1) complete
forgetting, where all the information learned about an environment is lost
after a restart, and (2) scheduled restarts, in which restarts occur only at
predefined timings, regardless of the incompatibility of the policy with the
current environment dynamics. We introduce three approaches, which we call
partial, adaptive, and selective restarts to modify the algorithms RestartQ-UCB
and RANDOMIZEDQ (Wang et al., 2025). We find near-optimal empirical performance
in multiple different environments, decreasing dynamic regret by up to $91$%
relative to RestartQ-UCB.

*Quentin Fruytier,Akshay Malhotra,Shahab Hamidi-Rad,Aditya Sant,Aryan Mokhtari,Sujay Sanghavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了VAE框架中KL散度正则化器在强制潜在空间匹配因子化高斯先验方面的不可靠性，并提出了基于最大均值差异(MMD)的可编程先验框架来有效实现解纠缠表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变分自编码器(VAE)框架使用KL散度惩罚来鼓励潜在空间匹配因子化高斯先验，但作者发现这种基于KL的正则化机制不可靠，无法在聚合后验上强制执行目标分布。

Method: 提出了可编程先验框架，该方法基于最大均值差异(MMD)，允许从业者明确地塑造潜在空间，而无需常见的重建权衡。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和Tiny ImageNet等复杂数据集上实现了最先进的相互独立性，并且展示了这种可编程性如何用于设计复杂的先验以改善与语义有意义特征的对齐。

Conclusion: 这项工作为表示工程提供了基础工具，为模型可识别性和因果推理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation
are captured by independent latent variables, is a central goal in machine
learning. The dominant approach has been the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
framework, which uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to encourage
the latent space to match a factorized Gaussian prior. In this work, however,
we provide direct evidence that this KL-based regularizer is an unreliable
mechanism, consistently failing to enforce the target distribution on the
aggregate posterior. We validate this and quantify the resulting entanglement
using our novel, unsupervised Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address
this failure, we introduce the Programmable Prior Framework, a method built on
the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Our framework allows practitioners to
explicitly sculpt the latent space, achieving state-of-the-art mutual
independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the
common reconstruction trade-off. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this
programmability can be used to engineer sophisticated priors that improve
alignment with semantically meaningful features. Ultimately, our work provides
a foundational tool for representation engineering, opening new avenues for
model identifiability and causal reasoning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出Y形生成流，通过共享路径移动概率质量，然后分支到特定端点，优于传统的V形传输方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代连续时间生成模型通常采用V形传输，样本独立沿直线轨迹从先验到数据移动，忽略了共享结构。

Method: 引入Y形生成流，基于具有次线性指数的新型速度驱动传输成本，在可扩展的神经ODE训练目标中实现。

Result: 在合成、图像和生物学数据集上，Y流恢复了层次感知结构，在分布指标上优于基于流的基线方法，并以更少的积分步骤达到目标。

Conclusion: Y形生成流通过共享路径和分支结构，有效改善了生成模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport:
each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior
to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows,
which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to
target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered
transport cost with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave
dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate
the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and
biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve
distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with
fewer integration steps.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MosaicDiff框架，通过轨迹感知的结构剪枝将扩散模型预训练动态与后训练采样加速对齐，根据预训练不同阶段的学习速度差异进行自适应剪枝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的预训练过程存在明显的学习速度阶段差异，但之前的后训练加速方法完全忽略了这一现象。

Method: 基于预训练动态的轨迹感知结构剪枝：中间快速学习阶段采用保守剪枝以保留关键特征，早期和后期慢速学习阶段采用更激进的剪枝策略。

Result: 在DiT和SDXL上的广泛实验表明，该方法在不影响输出质量的情况下显著加速采样，大幅超越之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: MosaicDiff为更高效和鲁棒的无训练扩散加速提供了新视角，首次将模型内部训练动态与加速采样过程协调统一。

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their
pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been
entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the
community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that
aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration
via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation
that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more
conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and
later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.
This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent
learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the
model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.
Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves
significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also
providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion
acceleration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Transformer理解方法缺乏数学框架来建模各层在状态转换中的作用，受量子力学与语言模型概率特性的相似性启发，寻求跨学科描述框架。

Method: 将Transformer的潜在激活转换为希尔伯特空间状态向量，将隐藏层重新定义为酉算子和哈密顿量，通过玻恩规则获得最终概率分布。

Result: 通过玩具Transformer的概念验证，展示了QLENS在分析模型预测轨迹中各层影响的潜力。

Conclusion: QLENS为跨领域洞察提供了基础，有助于更广泛地理解Transformer模型。

Abstract: In natural language processing, current methods for understanding
Transformers are successful at identifying intermediate predictions during a
model's inference. However, these approaches function as limited diagnostic
checkpoints, lacking a mathematical framework for mechanistically modeling how
each layer facilitates transitions between these evolving states. This
interpretability gap and past successes of interdisciplinary outlooks inspire
us to turn to physics in search of a descriptive mathematical framework for
Transformers. We observe that language models are intrinsically probabilistic,
an attribute that is echoed in the core postulates of quantum mechanics. This
parallel inspires us to translate insights from this discipline to that of
natural language processing. Towards this objective, we propose QLENS a novel
attempt to develop a physics-based perspective on the Transformer generation
process. Under QLENS, a Transformer is studied by converting its latent
activations into a state vector in a Hilbert space derived from the model's
output units. This state subsequently evolves through hidden layers -
reformulated as unitary operators and analogously defined Hamiltonians - during
inference. The model's final probability distribution is obtained by applying
the Born rule to the end state using a specific measurement operator. To
demonstrate QLENS's potential, we conduct a proof-of-concept by probing a toy
Transformer to investigate the influence of individual layers in a model's
prediction trajectory. We present our work as a foundation for cross-domain
insights to be leveraged towards a broader understanding of Transformers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CW-DPO是一种两阶段的视觉语言模型对齐方法，通过温和负样本的监督微调和基于冷却权重的DPO优化，解决了传统偏好微调中梯度不稳定问题，实现了更稳定训练、更好校准和更高胜率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于偏好的视觉语言模型微调存在脆弱性，错误的负样本会产生无信息梯度，导致训练不稳定。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段使用温和负样本进行监督微调，第二阶段在DPO目标中通过冷却权重缩放负项，抑制无信息梯度。

Result: CW-DPO在多种VLM任务中表现出更稳定的优化、更好的校准、更高的配对胜率，且收敛步数更少。

Conclusion: 在冷却偏好之前平滑学习动态是稳健VLM对齐的简单通用原则。

Abstract: Preference-based finetuning of vision--language models (VLMs) is brittle:
trivially wrong negatives inject uninformative gradients that destabilize
training. We recast alignment as \textbf{learning-dynamics--aware optimization}
and introduce \textbf{Cooling-Weighted DPO (CW-DPO)}, a two-stage recipe that
explicitly models and exploits the training trajectory. \textbf{Stage 1}
performs supervised finetuning with \textbf{gentle negatives}:
\textbf{low-weight smoothed supervision} that regularizes the base policy and
curbs overconfidence without explicit penalties. \textbf{Stage 2} applies a DPO
objective in which the \textbf{negative term is scaled by a cooling weight}
computed from the model's \textbf{average token log-probability} on each
negative, suppressing uninformative gradients from easy or off-distribution
samples while preserving signal from hard negatives. In practice, we emphasize
\textbf{on-policy negatives} and allow \textbf{mixed negatives} by blending a
controllable fraction of dataset negatives to maintain contrast freshness.
Throughout, we instrument training with $\Delta\!\log p$ probes on positives
and negatives as first-class signals for early stopping, curriculum design, and
failure diagnosis. Across diverse VLM tasks, CW-DPO yields \textbf{more stable
optimization}, \textbf{better calibration}, and \textbf{higher pairwise
win-rates} than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while \textbf{converging in fewer
steps}. Ablations isolate the \textbf{cooling-weight mechanism} as the primary
driver of these gains and show complementary benefits from mixing on-policy and
dataset negatives. Taken together, our results show that \textbf{smoothing
learning dynamics before cooling preferences} is a simple, general principle
for robust VLM alignment.

TL;DR: 该论文对Mamba模型的上下文学习能力进行理论分析，证明其在低维非线性目标函数任务中能够通过测试时特征学习实现高效上下文学习，样本复杂度优于线性Transformer且与非线性Transformer相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba作为新提出的线性时间序列模型，虽然计算效率高且实证性能强，但其底层机制的理论理解仍然有限，需要对其上下文学习能力进行严格的理论分析。

Method: 研究Mamba在单索引模型y≈g*(⟨β,x⟩)上的上下文学习能力，通过梯度预训练方法，分析Mamba如何通过测试时特征学习从上下文示例中提取相关方向β。

Result: 证明Mamba能够实现高效的上下文学习，其测试时样本复杂度优于线性Transformer（表现为核方法），且与非线性Transformer相当，能够超越相关统计查询下界并达到接近信息理论最优速率。

Conclusion: 分析揭示了Mamba中非线性门控机制在特征提取中的关键作用，这是Mamba能够同时实现计算效率和高性能的根本驱动力。

Abstract: Mamba, a recently proposed linear-time sequence model, has attracted
significant attention for its computational efficiency and strong empirical
performance. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its underlying
mechanisms remains limited. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capability by focusing on tasks defined by
low-dimensional nonlinear target functions. Specifically, we study in-context
learning of a single-index model $y \approx g_*(\langle \boldsymbol{\beta},
\boldsymbol{x} \rangle)$, which depends on only a single relevant direction
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$, referred to as feature. We prove that Mamba, pretrained
by gradient-based methods, can achieve efficient ICL via test-time feature
learning, extracting the relevant direction directly from context examples.
Consequently, we establish a test-time sample complexity that improves upon
linear Transformers -- analyzed to behave like kernel methods -- and is
comparable to nonlinear Transformers, which have been shown to surpass the
Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower bound and achieve near
information-theoretically optimal rate in previous works. Our analysis reveals
the crucial role of the nonlinear gating mechanism in Mamba for feature
extraction, highlighting it as the fundamental driver behind Mamba's ability to
achieve both computational efficiency and high performance.

Conclusion: 自回归方法为研究生成分类器提供了新视角，具有可扩展性、可解释性和抗灾难性遗忘等独特优势。

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
tasks.

Motivation: 现有深度学习睡眠分期模型在未见受试者上泛化能力差，领域泛化方法中的对比学习未能充分提取领域不变特征，需要解决嵌入在样本间未共享信息中的领域特征。

Method: 提出MEASURE框架，通过多尺度最小充分表示学习，在减少领域相关信息的同时保留睡眠分期所需的关键时域和频域特征。

Result: 在公开睡眠分期基准数据集SleepEDF-20和MASS上的实验表明，该方法持续优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: MEASURE框架能有效减少领域相关信息，同时保留睡眠分期所需的时域和频域特征，在领域泛化方面表现优异。

Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in
performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders.
However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to
variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization
approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on
unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning
has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning
samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many
existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant
representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics
embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we
posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess
domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the
direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits
features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the
diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature
levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE
minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively
reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and
spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments
on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS,
our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Our
code is available at : https://github.com/ku-milab/Measure

TL;DR: 本文提出H4G框架解决文本属性图中零样本学习的过抽象问题，通过降低双曲嵌入半径来保留细粒度结构信息，在异质性和同质性图上分别实现12.8%和8.4%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理需要细粒度模式识别的任务时表现不佳，特别是在异质性图上。通过实证和理论分析发现存在过抽象问题：当前方法在过大的双曲半径下操作，将多尺度结构信息压缩为统一的高层抽象，导致关键局部模式丢失。

Method: 提出H4G框架，使用可学习的块对角缩放矩阵和Möbius矩阵乘法系统性地降低嵌入半径，从而恢复对细粒度模式的访问，同时以最小计算开销保持全局感知能力。

Result: 实验表明H4G在零样本性能上达到最先进水平，在异质性图上提升12.8%，在同质性图上提升8.4%。

Conclusion: 半径减小能够实现忠实的多尺度表示，推动零样本图学习的进展。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs are widely used across domains, offering rich
opportunities for zero-shot learning via graph-text alignment. However,
existing methods struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained pattern
recognition, particularly on heterophilic graphs. Through empirical and
theoretical analysis, we identify an \textbf{over-abstraction problem}: current
approaches operate at excessively large hyperbolic radii, compressing
multi-scale structural information into uniform high-level abstractions. This
abstraction-induced information loss obscures critical local patterns essential
for accurate predictions. By analyzing embeddings in hyperbolic space, we
demonstrate that optimal graph learning requires \textbf{faithful preservation}
of fine-grained structural details, better retained by representations
positioned closer to the origin. To address this, we propose \textbf{H4G}, a
framework that systematically reduces embedding radii using learnable
block-diagonal scaling matrices and M\"obius matrix multiplication. This
approach restores access to fine-grained patterns while maintaining global
receptive ability with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show H4G
achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with \textbf{12.8\%}
improvement on heterophilic graphs and \textbf{8.4\%} on homophilic graphs,
confirming that radius reduction enables faithful multi-scale representation
for advancing zero-shot graph learning.

TL;DR: Chimera是一个统一模型，通过状态空间模型直接融入数据拓扑结构，无需领域特定的偏置，在语言、视觉和图数据上均取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer方法依赖自注意力机制，将数据视为无序集合，忽略了数据的邻域结构或图拓扑，需要设计任务特定的偏置（如位置嵌入、随机游走）来融入拓扑，但这些偏置设计费时且可能阻碍泛化。

Method: 提出Chimera模型，将状态空间模型（自然不需要位置嵌入）推广到捕获任意图拓扑，并提出了算法优化：对于有向无环图可实现线性时间递归，对于一般图通过数学松弛达到Transformer的二次复杂度。

Result: 在GLUE上比BERT高0.7分，在ImageNet-1k上比ViT高2.6%，在Long Range Graph Benchmark上优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: 验证了Chimera的核心贡献，支持数据拓扑是跨模态的强大归纳偏置这一理念。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning methods have become the standard approach for
modeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely
on self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This
ignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires
inductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or
random walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such
task-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects
that hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly
incorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for
domain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which
naturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any
graph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance
across language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7
points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph
Benchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's
efficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a
linear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical
relaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific
heuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the
idea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities.

Motivation: 现有图少样本学习方法存在两个关键局限：1）使用预定义的统一图滤波器无法处理真实图中局部拓扑结构的异质性；2）假设支持集和查询集来自相同分布，但在少样本条件下有限的标注数据可能无法充分捕捉查询集的复杂分布。

Method: 提出GRACE框架，包含两个核心技术：1）自适应频谱专家，根据局部拓扑结构动态调整频谱操作；2）跨集分布校准技术，缓解支持集和查询集之间的分布差异。

Result: 理论分析表明该方法通过适应局部结构变化和跨集分布校准来增强模型泛化能力；实证结果显示GRACE在各种实验设置下始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: GRACE框架有效解决了图少样本学习中的局部结构异质性和跨集分布不匹配问题，为图少样本学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph few-shot learning has attracted increasing attention due to its ability
to rapidly adapt models to new tasks with only limited labeled nodes. Despite
the remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods,
several key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on
predefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to
globally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral
operations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological
structures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume
that the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However,
under few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not
sufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to
suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a
novel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum
experts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques. Theoretically, the
proposed approach enhances model generalization by adapting to both local
structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration. Empirically,
GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range
of experimental settings. Our code can be found here.

Conclusion: 预算学习在生存数据分析中具有实际应用价值，能够有效利用有限预算获取最有价值的标签信息，提高模型性能，为现实世界数据收集提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset.
Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a
budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some
unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore
budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right)
censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's
time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored
instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from
(3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about
one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or
perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data
collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to
uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data
collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We
provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply
state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the
respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and
time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning
method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show
that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several
benchmarks.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理过程中经常进行反思，但LLMs在链式思维中检测错误的能力有限，反思如何贡献于经验改进仍不清楚，因此需要分析这个问题。

Method: 提出一个最小化推理框架，支持小型transformer进行基本的自我验证反思，确保分析清晰度并降低综合实验成本。理论上证明自我验证反思在验证误差有界时能保证改进。

chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), where they self-verify the correctness of current
solutions and explore alternatives. However, given recent findings that LLMs
detect limited errors in CoTs, how reflection contributes to empirical
improvements remains unclear. To analyze this issue, in this paper, we present
a minimalistic reasoning framework to support basic self-verifying reflection
for small transformers without natural language, which ensures analytic clarity
and reduces the cost of comprehensive experiments. Theoretically, we prove that
self-verifying reflection guarantees improvements if verification errors are
properly bounded. Experimentally, we show that tiny transformers, with only a
few million parameters, benefit from self-verification in both training and
reflective execution, reaching remarkable LLM-level performance in integer
multiplication and Sudoku. Similar to LLM results, we find that reinforcement
learning (RL) improves in-distribution performance and incentivizes frequent
reflection for tiny transformers, yet RL mainly optimizes shallow statistical
patterns without faithfully reducing verification errors. In conclusion,
integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification inherently
facilitates CoT reasoning, regardless of scaling and natural language.

*Hanru Bai,Weiyang Ding,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出分层Koopman扩散框架，实现一步采样和可解释生成轨迹，解决扩散模型采样慢与可解释性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但采样过程缓慢；而现有的一步方法虽然加速了推理，却牺牲了扩散动力学的可解释性和细粒度控制能力。

Method: 基于Koopman算子理论，将非线性扩散动力学提升到潜在空间，通过全局线性算子控制演化；设计分层架构，通过尺度特定Koopman子空间解耦不同空间分辨率的生成动态。

Result: 分层Koopman扩散不仅实现了一步生成性能的竞争力，还通过谱分析提供了理解和操作生成过程的原理机制。

Conclusion: 该框架弥合了扩散模型中快速采样与可解释性之间的差距，为生成建模中的可解释图像合成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image
generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative
denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by
learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability
and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that
enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we
introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that
achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories.
Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion
dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear
operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only
eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate
states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the
multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that
disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific
Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We
empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves
competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled
mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through
spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and
interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image
synthesis in generative modeling.

TL;DR: 本文提出了IMDGA框架，一种可解释的多维图攻击方法，统一了对图结构和文本特征的多层次扰动攻击，揭示了Graph-LLM的语义维度漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-LLM在结合图结构和文本语义时引入了关键漏洞，现有攻击方法仅针对单一维度，缺乏统一的多维攻击框架。

Method: IMDGA框架包含三个紧密集成的模块，在保持可解释性的同时协调图结构和文本特征的多层次扰动攻击。

Result: 在多个数据集和架构上的实证评估表明，IMDGA在可解释性、攻击效果、隐蔽性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了Graph-LLM中先前未被充分探索的语义维度漏洞，为提升其韧性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a pivotal framework for modeling
graph-structured data, enabling a wide range of applications from social
network analysis to molecular chemistry. By integrating large language models
(LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich
textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based
learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical
vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both
their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack
methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified
them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable
Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial
attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both
graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated
modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a
deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical
analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and
architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack
effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By
exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers
a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs,
offering valuable insights for improving their resilience. Our code and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理分子图结构时存在两个主要限制：1）优化共享参数空间，限制了模型捕捉实例特定结构特征的能力；2）为分子任务微调LLM可能导致灾难性遗忘，削弱其通用推理能力。

Method: MoRA方法为每个输入分子图生成独特的低秩适应权重，这些权重动态注入冻结的LLM中，使模型能够根据每个分子输入的结构调整推理，同时保留LLM的核心知识。

Result: 在关键分子任务上，MoRA的实例特定动态适应优于静态适应基线，包括反应预测精确匹配相对提升14.1%，量子性质预测误差减少22%。

Conclusion: MoRA通过实例特定的动态适应方法，有效解决了分子图结构与LLM集成中的关键挑战，在保持LLM通用推理能力的同时提升了分子任务的性能。

Abstract: Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models
(LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal
alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or
adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main
limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular
inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural
features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In
this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an
instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule
on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)
that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input
molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM,
allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular
input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction
and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation
outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative
improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for
quantum property prediction. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在表演性学习中，数据分布会因部署的模型而改变（如用户策略性调整特征），这比传统监督学习更复杂。需要同时优化当前数据模型并考虑模型可能引导分布变化，但不知道具体变化性质。

Method: 研究高维岭回归中正则化的影响，分析表演性效应在不同参数化情况下的作用，并通过合成和真实数据集进行实证评估。

Result: 表演性效应在总体设置下会恶化测试风险，但在过参数化情况下可能有益。最优正则化强度与表演性效应整体强度成比例，可以据此设置正则化参数。

Conclusion: 正则化是应对表演性效应的有效工具，特别是在过参数化情况下。通过理解表演性效应强度与最优正则化的关系，可以更好地设置模型参数。

Abstract: In performative learning, the data distribution reacts to the deployed model
- for example, because strategic users adapt their features to game it - which
creates a more complex dynamic than in classical supervised learning. One
should thus not only optimize the model for the current data but also take into
account that the model might steer the distribution in a new direction, without
knowing the exact nature of the potential shift. We explore how regularization
can help cope with performative effects by studying its impact in
high-dimensional ridge regression. We show that, while performative effects
worsen the test risk in the population setting, they can be beneficial in the
over-parameterized regime where the number of features exceeds the number of
samples. We show that the optimal regularization scales with the overall
strength of the performative effect, making it possible to set the
regularization in anticipation of this effect. We illustrate this finding
through empirical evaluations of the optimal regularization parameter on both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs), as a leading class of generative models, offer key
advantages for reinforcement learning (RL), including multi-modal
expressiveness, stable training, and trajectory-level planning. This survey
delivers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of diffusion-based RL. We
first provide an overview of RL, highlighting its challenges, and then
introduce the fundamental concepts of DMs, investigating how they are
integrated into RL frameworks to address key challenges in this research field.
We establish a dual-axis taxonomy that organizes the field along two orthogonal
dimensions: a function-oriented taxonomy that clarifies the roles DMs play
within the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates
implementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide
a comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to
multi-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration
and highlighting their practical utility. Furthermore, we outline several
categories of successful applications of diffusion-based RL across diverse
domains, discuss open research issues of current methodologies, and highlight
key directions for future research to advance the field. Finally, we summarize
the survey to identify promising future development directions. We are actively
maintaining a GitHub repository (https://github.com/ChangfuXu/D4RL-FTD) for
papers and other related resources to apply DMs for RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiLoRA是一个无需训练的框架，通过自适应分层路由在LoRA池中进行选择，解决了现有方法需要显式任务标签或额外训练的问题，在领域泛化方面取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA重用方法通常依赖显式任务标签或额外训练，这在部署中不实用，而且它们通常激活固定数量的整个LoRA模块，导致参数冗余或不足，从而降低性能。

Method: HiLoRA利用LoRA的结构特性定义秩一组件(ROCs)，将每个秩参数视为独立单元。对于给定输入序列，首先在序列级别基于高斯似然自适应选择LoRA子集并确定其ROC分配，然后在令牌级别通过激活最信息丰富的ROCs进一步细化路由。

Result: 大量实验表明，HiLoRA在领域泛化方面取得了显著改进，相比最先进的基线方法准确率提升高达55%，同时保持相当的推理吞吐量。

Conclusion: HiLoRA提供了一个无需训练的高效框架，通过自适应分层路由机制有效解决了LoRA重用中的参数冗余问题，在领域泛化任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely used technique for
adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains, due to its modular design
and broad availability on platforms such as HuggingFace. This availability has
motivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.
  However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional
training, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically
activate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy
or insufficiency that degrade performance.
  In this paper, we propose \texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that
performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural
properties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank
parameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence,
\texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their
ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the
token level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative
ROCs.
  We further provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{HiLoRA} selects the
most relevant LoRAs with high probability.
  Extensive experiments show that \texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial
improvements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\small
$55\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference
throughput.

Motivation: 现有自我改进方法在神经组合优化中存在计算成本高、无法有效利用多智能体协调结构的问题，特别是无法处理智能体排列对称性，限制了泛化能力和协调行为的学习。

Result: 在多个组合优化问题上验证了方法的有效性，相比标准自我改进方法，在最终解质量和生成延迟方面均取得一致改进。

Conclusion: 通过多智能体联合动作和集合预测损失，显著提升了自我改进方法的样本效率、协调能力和生成速度。

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a state-of-the-art paradigm in Neural
Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), where models iteratively refine their
policies by generating and imitating high-quality solutions. Despite strong
empirical performance, existing methods face key limitations. Training is
computationally expensive, as policy updates require sampling numerous
candidate solutions per instance to extract a single expert trajectory. More
fundamentally, these approaches fail to exploit the structure of combinatorial
problems involving the coordination of multiple agents, such as vehicles in
min-max routing or machines in scheduling. By supervising on single-action
trajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct
sequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and
the ability to learn coordinated behavior.
  We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over
joint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task
assignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries,
we employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert
assignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and
the model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating
multi-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution
generation phase of the self-improvement loop. Empirically, we validate our
method on several combinatorial problems, demonstrating consistent improvements
in the quality of the final solution and a reduced generation latency compared
to standard self-improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PIELM在处理包含高频和变频行为的偏微分方程时面临挑战，需要一种能够有效捕捉不同频率分量的改进方法。

Method: 将傅里叶特征映射变体集成到ELM中作为基于傅里叶的激活函数；为隐藏神经元分配频率系数；开发基于ELM输出权重分布的初始化方法。

Result: 在5个案例研究共10个数值示例中验证了GFF-PIELM的可行性，相比传统PIELM显著提高了预测精度，且不增加训练时间和架构复杂度。

Conclusion: GFF-PIELM成功扩展了PIELM解决高频和变频PDE的能力，其初始化策略可能启发其他物理信息机器学习框架的改进。

Abstract: Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces
challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving
high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges,
we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine
(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier
feature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it
difficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find
an alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we
integrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,
so there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we
assign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM
network to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,
we develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these
hyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM
not only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM
framework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle
high-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten
numerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed
GFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour,
irregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the
GFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without
additional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results
confirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and
variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may
further inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SPI保证主要关注离线、表格化强化学习，缺乏在在线设置中结合世界模型和表示学习的理论框架。

Method: 开发理论框架，将策略更新限制在当前策略的邻域内；引入DeepSPI算法，结合局部转移和奖励损失与正则化策略更新。

Result: 在ALE-57基准测试中，DeepSPI匹配或超过了PPO和DeepMDPs等强基线方法，同时保持理论保证。

Conclusion: 该研究为在线深度强化学习提供了理论保证，将经典SPI定理扩展到深度设置，并在实践中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) offers theoretical control over policy updates,
yet existing guarantees largely concern offline, tabular reinforcement learning
(RL). We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model
and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that
restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy
ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition
and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep"
analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on
these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that
couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On
the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including
PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实用的强化学习算法采用演化奖励函数（如奖励塑造、熵正则化、课程学习），但这些技术的理论基础尚未充分发展。本文旨在为这些流行RL技术提供理论支撑。

Method: 采用单时间尺度actor-critic算法，考虑奖励参数在每个时间步可能变化的情况，影响策略优化和值估计。在标准假设下，推导了actor和critic误差的非渐近界。

Result: 证明了在奖励参数演化足够缓慢的情况下，可以达到O(1/√T)的收敛速率，与静态奖励的最佳已知速率相匹配。当奖励通过有界梯度的基于梯度的规则更新时，该速率得以保持。

Conclusion: 为许多流行的RL技术提供了理论基础，证明了演化奖励函数下的收敛性能与静态奖励相当。作为次要贡献，在静态奖励情况下改进了分布不匹配分析的最佳已知速率，减少了log²T因子。

Abstract: Many popular practical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms employ evolving
reward functions-through techniques such as reward shaping, entropy
regularization, or curriculum learning-yet their theoretical foundations remain
underdeveloped. This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis
of a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm in the presence of an evolving
reward function under Markovian sampling. We consider a setting where the
reward parameters may change at each time step, affecting both policy
optimization and value estimation. Under standard assumptions, we derive
non-asymptotic bounds for both actor and critic errors. Our result shows that
an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate
for static rewards, provided the reward parameters evolve slowly enough. This
rate is preserved when the reward is updated via a gradient-based rule with
bounded gradient and on the same timescale as the actor and critic, offering a
theoretical foundation for many popular RL techniques. As a secondary
contribution, we introduce a novel analysis of distribution mismatch under
Markovian sampling, improving the best-known rate by a factor of $\log^2T$ in
the static-reward case.

Motivation: 大型组织在确保数据质量方面面临挑战，传统方法主要关注单一模态（如表），容易忽略跨模态错误，特别是在电子商务和医疗等图像、表格和文本数据共存的领域。

Method: 在表格数据上进行跨模态错误检测的基准测试，评估了四种数据集和五种基线方法，包括Cleanlab标签错误检测框架和DataScope数据评估方法，结合AutoML框架进行性能比较。

Result: Cleanlab和DataScope方法在结合强大的AutoML框架时表现最佳，获得了最高的F1分数。

Conclusion: 当前方法在处理重尾真实世界数据时仍然有限，需要在这一领域进行进一步研究。

Abstract: Ensuring data quality at scale remains a persistent challenge for large
organizations. Despite recent advances, maintaining accurate and consistent
data is still complex, especially when dealing with multiple data modalities.
Traditional error detection and correction methods tend to focus on a single
modality, typically a table, and often miss cross-modal errors that are common
in domains like e-Commerce and healthcare, where image, tabular, and text data
co-exist. To address this gap, we take an initial step towards cross-modal
error detection in tabular data, by benchmarking several methods. Our
evaluation spans four datasets and five baseline approaches. Among them,
Cleanlab, a label error detection framework, and DataScope, a data valuation
method, perform the best when paired with a strong AutoML framework, achieving
the highest F1 scores. Our findings indicate that current methods remain
limited, particularly when applied to heavy-tailed real-world data, motivating
further research in this area.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cautious Weight Decay (CWD) 是一种优化器无关的权重衰减改进方法，只在参数坐标与优化器更新方向一致时应用权重衰减，无需额外超参数调优即可提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准解耦权重衰减隐式优化正则化或约束目标，而CWD旨在保持原始损失函数不变，寻找未修改目标的局部帕累托最优稳定点。

Method: CWD是一种一行代码修改，仅对与优化器更新方向一致的参数坐标应用权重衰减，可视为双层优化问题，在达到稳定流形时诱导滑模行为。

Result: 在语言模型预训练和ImageNet分类任务中，CWD在百万到十亿参数规模下持续改善最终损失和准确率。

Conclusion: CWD是AdamW、Lion和Muon等优化器的即插即用改进，无需新超参数或额外调优即可提升模型性能。

Abstract: We introduce Cautious Weight Decay (CWD), a one-line, optimizer-agnostic
modification that applies weight decay only to parameter coordinates whose
signs align with the optimizer update. Unlike standard decoupled decay, which
implicitly optimizes a regularized or constrained objective, CWD preserves the
original loss and admits a bilevel interpretation: it induces sliding-mode
behavior upon reaching the stationary manifold, allowing it to search for
locally Pareto-optimal stationary points of the unmodified objective. In
practice, CWD is a drop-in change for optimizers such as AdamW, Lion, and Muon,
requiring no new hyperparameters or additional tuning. For language model
pre-training and ImageNet classification, CWD consistently improves final loss
and accuracy at million- to billion-parameter scales.

Motivation: 当前用于评估生成式AI模型生成无机晶体材料的距离函数存在四个主要问题：无法量化化合物间的相似程度、不能区分成分差异和结构差异、缺乏对原子坐标变化的Lipschitz连续性、以及独特性度量对生成样本排列不具不变性。

Method: 提出使用两种连续距离函数来评估生成式模型的独特性和新颖性，这些函数在理论上克服了传统距离函数的局限性。

Result: 实验表明，新提出的距离函数能够揭示传统距离函数遗漏的洞见，为评估和比较无机晶体的生成模型提供了更可靠的基础。

Conclusion: 连续距离函数为评估生成式AI模型在无机晶体材料生成方面的性能提供了更准确和可靠的度量标准。

Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change,
increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being
developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible
functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions
paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness
and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function.
However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to
quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish
compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity
against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that
is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we
propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and
novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show
that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions,
providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models
for inorganic crystals.

*Anush Anand,Pranav Agrawal,Tejas Bodas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于高斯过程的非参数动态定价方法，使用贝叶斯优化来学习未知需求函数，在无限和有限库存设置下都优于传统强化学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态定价方法通常假设需求函数具有特定参数形式，这在现实场景中可能不成立，限制了方法的适用性。

Method: 使用高斯过程对需求函数进行非参数建模，基于贝叶斯优化开发定价算法，适用于无限和有限库存两种设置。

Result: 实验表明基于贝叶斯优化的方法在收益方面优于多种最先进的强化学习算法，需要更少假设且具有更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯优化是复杂不确定环境下动态定价的强大实用工具，提供了后悔保证来量化学习效率。

Abstract: Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the selling price of a product
to maximize a firm's revenue by responding to market demand. The literature
typically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the
firm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both
inventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge
lies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is
unknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a
specific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of
reinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies.
However, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the
applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive
modeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of
the price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) --
a sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based
algorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide
regret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency
of our methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BO-based
methods outperform several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of revenue,
while requiring fewer assumptions and offering greater robustness. This
highlights Bayesian Optimization as a powerful and practical tool for dynamic
pricing in complex, uncertain environments.

### [71] [A Function Centric Perspective On Flat and Sharp Minima](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12451)
*Israel Mason-Williams,Gabryel Mason-Williams,Helen Yannakoudakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了平坦最小值与泛化性能的关系，提出尖锐度应被视为函数依赖属性而非泛化能力的可靠指标。研究发现正则化方法会产生更尖锐的最小值，但这些尖锐最小值往往伴随更好的泛化、校准、鲁棒性和功能一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为平坦最小值与更好的泛化性能相关，但近期研究发现了理论反例和经验例外。本文旨在重新探讨尖锐度在模型性能中的作用，挑战平坦最小值必然带来更好泛化的普遍认知。

Method: 进行了广泛的实证研究，从单目标优化到现代图像分类任务，测试了不同正则化方法（如SAM、权重衰减、数据增强）对损失地形几何的影响。

Result: 正则化模型倾向于收敛到更尖锐的最小值，但这些尖锐最小值在泛化、校准、鲁棒性和功能一致性方面表现更好。无正则化的基线模型虽然收敛到更平坦的最小值，但在所有安全指标上表现更差。

Conclusion: 函数复杂性而非平坦度单独决定了解的几何形状，尖锐最小值可以反映更合适的归纳偏置（特别是在正则化条件下），需要对损失地形几何进行以函数为中心的重新评估。

Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in
deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in
recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions
emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in
model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a
function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor
generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective
optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima
often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data
augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better
generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a
range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation
tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than
flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can
reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),
calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出TCVBM框架，将桥匹配方法扩展到时间相关视频序列，通过显式建模序列间依赖关系来提升视频生成任务中的时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在复杂分布间的转换能力有限，而现有的桥匹配方法未探索时间相关数据序列的应用，这在需要保持时间一致性的视频任务中是一个关键限制。

Method: 提出时间相关视频桥匹配(TCVBM)框架，在扩散桥中显式建模序列间依赖关系，将时间相关性直接融入采样过程。

Result: 在帧插值、图像到视频生成和视频超分辨率三个任务中，TCVBM在多个定量指标上均优于基于桥匹配和扩散模型的传统方法。

Conclusion: TCVBM通过显式建模时间相关性，显著提升了视频生成质量和重建保真度，为时间相关数据序列的桥匹配应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in noise-to-data generation tasks, providing a mapping
from a Gaussian distribution to a more complex data distribution. However they
struggle to model translations between complex distributions, limiting their
effectiveness in data-to-data tasks. While Bridge Matching (BM) models address
this by finding the translation between data distributions, their application
to time-correlated data sequences remains unexplored. This is a critical
limitation for video generation and manipulation tasks, where maintaining
temporal coherence is particularly important. To address this gap, we propose
Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM), a framework that extends BM to
time-correlated data sequences in the video domain. TCVBM explicitly models
inter-sequence dependencies within the diffusion bridge, directly incorporating
temporal correlations into the sampling process. We compare our approach to
classical methods based on bridge matching and diffusion models for three
video-related tasks: frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video
super-resolution. TCVBM achieves superior performance across multiple
quantitative metrics, demonstrating enhanced generation quality and
reconstruction fidelity.

*Beibu Li,Qichao Shentu,Yang Shu,Hui Zhang,Ming Li,Ning Jin,Bin Yang,Chenjuan Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CrossAD是一个新颖的时间序列异常检测框架，通过跨尺度关联和跨窗口建模来提升检测性能。该方法通过从粗粒度序列重构细粒度序列来显式捕获跨尺度关联，并利用查询库和全局多尺度上下文克服固定窗口大小的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常独立建模多尺度信息或依赖简单的特征融合策略，忽视了异常期间跨尺度关联的动态变化。大多数方法基于固定滑动窗口进行多尺度建模，限制了捕获全面上下文信息的能力。

Method: 提出跨尺度重构方法，从粗粒度序列重构细粒度序列以显式捕获跨尺度关联；设计查询库并整合全局多尺度上下文来克服固定窗口大小的限制。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上使用九种评估指标进行的广泛实验验证了CrossAD的有效性，展示了在异常检测方面的最先进性能。

Conclusion: CrossAD通过考虑跨尺度关联和跨窗口建模，在时间序列异常检测中实现了优异的性能，解决了现有方法在多尺度建模和上下文信息捕获方面的局限性。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Given that time series data can exhibit different
patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven
beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a
single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information
independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the
dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies.
Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding
windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time
series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window
modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that
reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing
cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and
incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by
fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world
datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.

*Jincheng Zhong,Boyuan Jiang,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Kun Gai,Mingsheng Long*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文发现扩散模型采样过程中存在噪声偏移问题——预定义噪声水平与中间状态实际噪声水平不匹配，导致生成质量下降。作者提出噪声感知引导(NAG)方法，通过校正采样轨迹来保持与预定义噪声调度的一致性，并引入无需外部分类器的无分类器变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去噪生成模型依赖于求解离散化的反向时间SDE或ODE，但作者发现这些模型普遍存在一个被长期忽视的问题：预定义噪声水平与采样过程中间状态实际编码的噪声水平之间存在错位，即噪声偏移问题。

Method: 提出噪声感知引导(NAG)方法，明确引导采样轨迹保持与预定义噪声调度的一致性。进一步引入无分类器变体NAG，通过噪声条件丢弃联合训练噪声条件和非噪声条件模型，无需外部分类器。

Result: 在ImageNet生成和各种监督微调任务上的广泛实验表明，NAG能持续缓解噪声偏移问题，显著提升主流扩散模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: 噪声偏移是扩散模型中普遍存在且被忽视的问题，NAG提供了一种简单有效的校正方法，能显著改善生成质量，为扩散模型的实际应用提供了重要改进。

Abstract: Existing denoising generative models rely on solving discretized reverse-time
SDEs or ODEs. In this paper, we identify a long-overlooked yet pervasive issue
in this family of models: a misalignment between the pre-defined noise level
and the actual noise level encoded in intermediate states during sampling. We
refer to this misalignment as noise shift. Through empirical analysis, we
demonstrate that noise shift is widespread in modern diffusion models and
exhibits a systematic bias, leading to sub-optimal generation due to both
out-of-distribution generalization and inaccurate denoising updates. To address
this problem, we propose Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG), a simple yet effective
correction method that explicitly steers sampling trajectories to remain
consistent with the pre-defined noise schedule. We further introduce a
classifier-free variant of NAG, which jointly trains a noise-conditional and a
noise-unconditional model via noise-condition dropout, thereby eliminating the
need for external classifiers. Extensive experiments, including ImageNet
generation and various supervised fine-tuning tasks, show that NAG consistently
mitigates noise shift and substantially improves the generation quality of
mainstream diffusion models.

Result: 实验结果显示，除了尺度变化外，可微分因果发现方法在常用挑战性场景下表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文旨在全面基准测试可微分因果发现方法在模型假设违反下的性能，为合理评估因果发现提供标准，并促进其在真实场景中的应用。

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to learn causal relationships between variables from
targeted data, making it a fundamental task in machine learning. However,
causal discovery algorithms often rely on unverifiable causal assumptions,
which are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world data, thereby limiting the
broad application of causal discovery in practical scenarios. Inspired by these
considerations, this work extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of
various mainstream causal discovery algorithms, which assume i.i.d. data, under
eight model assumption violations. Our experimental results show that
differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness under the metrics of
Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance of the
inferred graphs in commonly used challenging scenarios, except for scale
variation. We also provide the theoretical explanations for the performance of
differentiable causal discovery methods. Finally, our work aims to
comprehensively benchmark the performance of recent differentiable causal
discovery methods under model assumption violations, and provide the standard
for reasonable evaluation of causal discovery, as well as to further promote
its application in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了具有上下文信息的多臂老虎机问题，目标是在确保每个臂在不同上下文中获得最小聚合奖励的同时，最大化总累积奖励。该框架适用于需要公平收入分配且存在上下文变化的实际应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实应用中需要公平收入分配且存在上下文变化的问题，其中跨上下文的最小奖励约束聚合虽然能提升性能和可行性，但带来了技术挑战，特别是缺乏标准MAB设置中常见的闭式最优分配。

Method: 设计并分析了两种算法：乐观优先性能算法和悲观强制约束满足算法。针对每种算法推导了问题相关的遗憾和约束违反上界。

Result: 建立了问题相关的遗憾和约束违反上界，并证明了对时间范围依赖的最优性，揭示了先前工作中利用的自由探索原则的基本局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为具有跨上下文最小奖励约束的多臂老虎机问题提供了有效的算法解决方案，并建立了理论性能保证，揭示了此类问题的基本限制。

Abstract: We examine a multi-armed bandit problem with contextual information, where
the objective is to ensure that each arm receives a minimum aggregated reward
across contexts while simultaneously maximizing the total cumulative reward.
This framework captures a broad class of real-world applications where fair
revenue allocation is critical and contextual variation is inherent. The
cross-context aggregation of minimum reward constraints, while enabling better
performance and easier feasibility, introduces significant technical challenges
-- particularly the absence of closed-form optimal allocations typically
available in standard MAB settings. We design and analyze algorithms that
either optimistically prioritize performance or pessimistically enforce
constraint satisfaction. For each algorithm, we derive problem-dependent upper
bounds on both regret and constraint violations. Furthermore, we establish a
lower bound demonstrating that the dependence on the time horizon in our
results is optimal in general and revealing fundamental limitations of the free
exploration principle leveraged in prior work.

Abstract: The increasing popularity of portable ECG systems and the growing demand for
privacy-compliant, energy-efficient real-time analysis require new approaches
to signal processing at the point of data acquisition. In this context, the
edge domain is acquiring increasing importance, as it not only reduces latency
times, but also enables an increased level of data security. The FACE project
aims to develop an innovative machine learning solution for analysing long-term
electrocardiograms that synergistically combines the strengths of edge and
cloud computing. In this thesis, various pre-processing steps of ECG signals
are analysed with regard to their applicability in the project. The selection
of suitable methods in the edge area is based in particular on criteria such as
energy efficiency, processing capability and real-time capability.

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enable
cross-organization collaboration in machine learning model development without
directly sharing private data. Despite growing organizational interest driven
by data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, the adoption of
cross-silo FL remains limited in practice. In this paper, we conduct an
interview study to understand the practical challenges associated with
cross-silo FL adoption. With interviews spanning a diverse set of stakeholders
such as user organizations, software providers, and academic researchers, we
uncover various barriers, from concerns about model performance to questions of
incentives and trust between participating organizations. Our study shows that
cross-silo FL faces a set of challenges that have yet to be well-captured by
existing research in the area and are quite distinct from other forms of
federated learning such as cross-device FL. We end with a discussion on future
research directions that can help overcome these challenges.

Motivation: 理解知识蒸馏的功能影响，量化其压缩能力和知识转移效果，解耦压缩与架构缩减的关系。

Method: 采用假设检验、对照组和随机控制蒸馏方法，分析多种蒸馏变体和模型尺寸下的蒸馏缩放规律，涵盖12种实验设置、9种架构和7个数据集。

Result: 在某些模态和架构中存在统计显著的知识转移，但转移程度低于预期；在显著知识转移情况下，发现一致的严重负面知识不对称转移到学生模型。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏主要作为数据依赖的正则化器，具有负面不对称回报，而非压缩机制，在应用中存在安全隐患。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is often considered a compression mechanism when
judged on the resulting student's accuracy and loss, yet its functional impact
is poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the compression capacity of
knowledge distillation and the resulting knowledge transfer from a functional
perspective, decoupling compression from architectural reduction, which
provides an improved understanding of knowledge distillation. We employ
hypothesis testing, controls, and random control distillation to understand
knowledge transfer mechanisms across data modalities. To rigorously test the
breadth and limits of our analyses, we explore multiple distillation variants
and analyse distillation scaling laws across model sizes. Our findings
demonstrate that, while there is statistically significant knowledge transfer
in some modalities and architectures, the extent of this transfer is less
pronounced than anticipated, even under conditions designed to maximise
knowledge sharing. Notably, in cases of significant knowledge transfer, we
identify a consistent and severe asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to
the student, raising safety concerns in knowledge distillation applications.
Across 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets, our findings
show that knowledge distillation functions less as a compression mechanism and
more as a data-dependent regulariser with a negative asymmetric payoff.

Conclusion: 通过解耦变量发现和动力学拟合问题，利用预训练FIMs可以稳定表示学习过程，为快速粗粒度建模提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by
a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional
manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined
problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously
fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these
tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce
dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging
the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained
models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g.,
the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot
mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen
weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple,
simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of
concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded
into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast
and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.

Abstract: Many scientific fields, from medicine to seismology, rely on analyzing
sequences of events over time to understand complex systems. Traditionally,
machine learning models must be built and trained from scratch for each new
dataset, which is a slow and costly process. We introduce a new approach: a
single, powerful model that learns the underlying patterns of event data in
context. We trained this "foundation model" on millions of simulated event
sequences, teaching it a general-purpose understanding of how events can
unfold. As a result, our model can analyze new scientific data instantly,
without retraining, simply by looking at a few examples from the dataset. It
can also be quickly fine-tuned for even higher accuracy. This approach makes
sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates the pace of
scientific discovery.

Abstract: We propose SG-XDEAT (Sparsity-Guided Cross Dimensional and Cross-Encoding
Attention with Target Aware Conditioning), a novel framework designed for
supervised learning on tabular data. At its core, SG-XDEAT employs a
dual-stream encoder that decomposes each input feature into two parallel
representations: a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware)
stream. These dual representations are then propagated through a hierarchical
stack of attention-based modules. SG-XDEAT integrates three key components: (i)
Cross-Dimensional self-attention, which captures intra-view dependencies among
features within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention, which enables
bidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; and
(iii) an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) mechanism, which dynamically
suppresses low-utility tokens by driving their attention weights toward
zero--thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Empirical results on multiple
public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, confirming that
jointly modeling raw and target-aware views--while adaptively filtering
noise--yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

Abstract: Whisper models have achieved remarkable progress in speech recognition; yet
their large size remains a bottleneck for deployment on resource-constrained
edge devices. This paper proposes a framework to design fine-tuned variants of
Whisper which address the above problem. Structured sparsity is enforced via
the Sparse Group LASSO penalty as a loss regularizer, to reduce the number of
FLOating Point operations (FLOPs). Further, a weight statistics aware pruning
algorithm is proposed. We also design our custom text normalizer for WER
evaluation. On Common Voice 11.0 Hindi dataset, we obtain, without degrading
WER, (a) 35.4% reduction in model parameters, 14.25% lower memory consumption
and 18.5% fewer FLOPs on Whisper-small, and (b) 31% reduction in model
parameters, 15.29% lower memory consumption and 16.95% fewer FLOPs on
Whisper-medium; and, (c) substantially outperform the state-of-the-art
Iterative Magnitude Pruning based method by pruning 18.7% more parameters along
with a 12.31 reduction in WER.

Motivation: 传统谱聚类方法依赖特征向量计算，在大规模图上扩展性差。现有的稀疏化方法需要昂贵的预处理来计算有效电阻，作者希望研究简单的均匀边采样是否足够保持谱聚类所需的结构特性。

Method: 提出使用均匀边采样策略，通过分析图的结构比率$\Upsilon(k) = \lambda_{k+1} / \rho_G(k)$，证明在具有良好分离聚类的图中，采样$O(\gamma^2 n \log n / \epsilon^2)$条边即可保持谱子空间结构。

Result: 证明了均匀采样能够保持用于聚类的谱子空间，确保谱嵌入保持忠实性，聚类质量得到保留。这为均匀边采样在谱聚类中的应用提供了首个理论保证。

Conclusion: 在强聚类性条件下，均匀边采样具有结构感知能力，能够有效替代传统的基于重要性的采样方法，为大规模图的谱聚类提供了更简单高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a fundamental method for graph partitioning, but its
reliance on eigenvector computation limits scalability to massive graphs.
Classical sparsification methods preserve spectral properties by sampling edges
proportionally to their effective resistances, but require expensive
preprocessing to estimate these resistances. We study whether uniform edge
sampling-a simple, structure-agnostic strategy-can suffice for spectral
clustering. Our main result shows that for graphs admitting a well-separated
$k$-clustering, characterized by a large structure ratio $\Upsilon(k) =
\lambda_{k+1} / \rho_G(k)$, uniform sampling preserves the spectral subspace
used for clustering. Specifically, we prove that uniformly sampling $O(\gamma^2
n \log n / \epsilon^2)$ edges, where $\gamma$ is the Laplacian condition
number, yields a sparsifier whose top $(n-k)$-dimensional eigenspace is
approximately orthogonal to the cluster indicators. This ensures that the
spectral embedding remains faithful, and clustering quality is preserved. Our
analysis introduces new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a
rank-$(n-k)$ effective resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound
adapted to the dominant eigenspace. These tools allow us to bypass importance
sampling entirely. Conceptually, our result connects recent coreset-based
clustering theory to spectral sparsification, showing that under strong
clusterability, even uniform sampling is structure-aware. This provides the
first provable guarantee that uniform edge sampling suffices for
structure-preserving spectral clustering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CALM是一种推理时方法，通过修改模型最后一层的潜在表示来抑制有害概念，无需重新训练。它结合计算机视觉中的CW技术和正交投影，在保持模型性能的同时移除与有害内容相关的潜在方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型容易受到越狱攻击，这些攻击会绕过内置的安全护栏（例如通过对抗性提示欺骗模型）。需要一种轻量级方法来增强AI安全性，无需额外训练数据或模型微调。

Method: CALM利用计算机视觉中的CW技术结合正交投影，在推理时修改模型最后一层的潜在表示，移除与有害内容相关的潜在方向，同时保持其他功能不受影响。

Result: 实验表明CALM减少了有害输出，在大多数指标上优于基线方法，仅带来较小的计算开销。

Conclusion: CALM提供了一种轻量级的AI安全方法，无需额外训练数据或模型微调，在推理时有效抑制有害概念，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that bypass
built-in safety guardrails (e.g., by tricking the model with adversarial
prompts). We propose Concept Alignment and Concept Manipulation \textbf{CALM},
an inference-time method that suppresses harmful concepts by modifying latent
representations of the last layer of the model, without retraining. Leveraging
\gls*{cw} technique from Computer Vision combined with orthogonal projection,
CALM removes unwanted latent directions associated with harmful content while
preserving model performance. Experiments show that CALM reduces harmful
outputs and outperforms baseline methods in most metrics, offering a
lightweight approach to AI safety with no additional training data or model
fine-tuning, while incurring only a small computational overhead at inference.

TL;DR: 本文分析了混合思维LLMs的模式分离问题，发现当前模型在无思维模式下仍会出现推理行为。作者识别了影响可控性的四个关键因素，并提出了一种训练策略，能在保持两种模式准确性的同时显著减少无思维模式的输出长度和推理支持标记的出现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合思维LLMs允许在推理和直接回答之间切换，平衡效率和推理能力。但实验发现当前模型仅实现部分模式分离，推理行为经常泄漏到无思维模式中。

Method: 分析影响可控性的因素，识别出四个关键因素：更大的数据规模、使用不同问题的思维和无思维答案、适度增加无思维数据数量、采用两阶段训练策略（先训练推理能力，再应用混合思维训练）。

Result: 提出的训练配方相比标准训练，能在保持两种模式准确性的同时，显著减少无思维输出长度（在MATH500上从1085降至585）和推理支持标记的出现（如"wait"从5917降至522）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前混合思维的局限性，并为加强其可控性提供了方向。

Abstract: Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct
answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet
our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial
mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To
understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing
controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)
using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same
question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase
strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think
training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,
compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while
significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)
and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from
$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current
hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for
high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or
noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose
a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM)
from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional
diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and
then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in
the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the
DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image
reconstruction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 提出CARVQ方法，结合线性非线性映射的组合，通过校正适配器和分组残差向量量化来压缩嵌入层，无需专门硬件支持低位存储。

Result: 在多个预训练LLM上测试，包括LLaMA-3.2-1B、LLaMA-3.2-3B等模型，在生成、判别、数学和推理任务上，CARVQ能在保持合理困惑度和精度的同时实现更低的平均比特数。

Conclusion: CARVQ提供了一种与最先进变换器量化方法兼容的压缩技术，可无缝集成到支持4位内存的任何硬件中，是实现LLM在边缘设备高效部署的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on a large number of parameters
for token embedding, leading to substantial storage requirements and memory
footprints. In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and
reducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees
up the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we
introduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group
Residual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear
and non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to
approximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support
lower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B,
LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B
and Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning
tasks. We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average
bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy
compared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression
technique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization
methods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit
memory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices.
This work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs
on edge devices.

TL;DR: 本文研究了决策树学习中的局部搜索操作（调整切割阈值或交换特征）对最小化分类错误的影响，发现这些问题在一般情况下是NP完全的，但通过参数化复杂度分析确定了使问题可解的条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 决策树学习算法通常包含启发式局部搜索操作，但缺乏对这些操作计算复杂度的系统分析。本文旨在填补这一空白，确定哪些问题特性导致计算困难，哪些特性使问题可解。

Method: 采用参数化复杂度分析方法，考虑特征数量d和域大小D等参数。提出了一个固定参数可解算法，时间复杂度为(D+1)^(2d)·|I|^O(1)，并进行了概念验证实现和实证评估。

Result: 发现这些问题在一般情况下是NP完全的，但当特征数量d和域大小D都很小时，问题变得固定参数可解。算法在(D+1)^(2d)·|I|^O(1)时间内可解。

Conclusion: 通过参数化复杂度分析揭示了决策树局部搜索操作的计算特性，为理解这些操作的复杂性提供了理论依据，并展示了在特定条件下实现高效算法的可能性。

Abstract: Algorithms for learning decision trees often include heuristic local-search
operations such as (1) adjusting the threshold of a cut or (2) also exchanging
the feature of that cut. We study minimizing the number of classification
errors by performing a fixed number of a single type of these operations.
Although we discover that the corresponding problems are NP-complete in
general, we provide a comprehensive parameterized-complexity analysis with the
aim of determining those properties of the problems that explain the hardness
and those that make the problems tractable. For instance, we show that the
problems remain hard for a small number $d$ of features or small domain size
$D$ but the combination of both yields fixed-parameter tractability. That is,
the problems are solvable in $(D + 1)^{2d} \cdot |I|^{O(1)}$ time, where $|I|$
is the size of the input. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation of
this algorithm and report on empirical results.

Conclusion: UNIVERSE方法为变量重要性分析提供了更稳健的框架，能够处理缺失特征和Rashomon效应带来的挑战，在科学验证和特征选择中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Variable importance (VI) methods are often used for hypothesis generation,
feature selection, and scientific validation. In the standard VI pipeline, an
analyst estimates VI for a single predictive model with only the observed
features. However, the importance of a feature depends heavily on which other
variables are included in the model, and essential variables are often omitted
from observational datasets. Moreover, the VI estimated for one model is often
not the same as the VI estimated for another equally-good model - a phenomenon
known as the Rashomon Effect. We address these gaps by introducing
UNobservables and Inference for Variable importancE using Rashomon SEts
(UNIVERSE). Our approach adapts Rashomon sets - the sets of near-optimal models
in a dataset - to produce bounds on the true VI even with missing features. We
theoretically guarantee the robustness of our approach, show strong performance
on semi-synthetic simulations, and demonstrate its utility in a credit risk
task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究如何构建概率预测器，使其能够在下游用户做出决策时提供准确信息。针对单一决策者，最优预测器设计等同于最小化与该个体负效用对应的适当损失函数。对于多个决策者，该问题可视为一种omniprediction变体，目标是设计单一预测器同时最小化多个损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机在于解决多决策者场景下的预测器设计问题，现有方法存在样本复杂度次优或返回复杂随机化预测器的缺点，需要开发更高效的算法。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1）通过在线到批处理的转换获得样本高效算法，但会产生复杂随机化预测器；2）设计更直接的非随机化算法，利用适当损失函数集合的结构元素。

Result: 给出了下界证明，表明多校准（multicalibration）是比omniprediction更困难的问题，因此前者方法必须承受次优的样本复杂度。改进后的非随机化算法能够更有效地解决omniprediction问题。

Conclusion: 通过利用适当损失函数的结构特性，可以设计出更直接、非随机化的高效算法来解决多决策者场景下的omniprediction问题，避免了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing probabilistic predictions that lead
to accurate decisions when employed by downstream users to inform actions. For
a single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to
minimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that
individual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a
variant of omniprediction in which the goal is to design a single predictor
that simultaneously minimizes multiple losses. Existing algorithms for
achieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods
that optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain
omniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based
approaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case" loss in an online
fashion. We give lower bounds demonstrating that multicalibration is a strictly
more difficult problem than omniprediction and thus the former approach must
incur suboptimal sample complexity. For the latter approach, we discuss how
these ideas can be used to obtain a sample-efficient algorithm through an
online-to-batch conversion. This conversion has the downside of returning a
complex, randomized predictor. We improve on this method by designing a more
direct, unrandomized algorithm that exploits structural elements of the set of
proper losses.
