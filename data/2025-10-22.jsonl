However, there is an increasing recognition that RAN\ndata access to apps could become a source of vulnerability and be exploited by\nmalicious actors. Motivated by this, we carry out a comprehensive investigation\nof data vulnerabilities on both xApps and rApps, respectively hosted in Near-\nand Non-real-time (RT) RIC components of O-RAN.

We revisit three classes of\nwatermarking through this lens. \\emph{Model watermarking} naturally aligns with\nLLM provider interests, yet faces new challenges in open-source ecosystems.\n\\emph{LLM text watermarking} offers modest provider benefit when framed solely\nas an anti-misuse tool, but can gain traction in narrowly scoped settings such\nas dataset de-contamination or user-controlled provenance. \\emph{In-context\nwatermarking} (ICW) is tailored for trusted parties, such as conference\norganizers or educators, who embed hidden watermarking instructions into\ndocuments. If a dishonest reviewer or student submits this text to an LLM, the\noutput carries a detectable watermark indicating misuse. This setup aligns\nincentives: users experience no quality loss, trusted parties gain a detection\ntool, and LLM providers remain neutral by simply following watermark\ninstructions. We advocate for a broader exploration of incentive-aligned\nmethods, with ICW as an example, in domains where trusted parties need reliable\ntools to detect misuse.

We\naddress these challenges with three key innovations: First, we propose the\n\\emph{Bayesian value function} to characterize the optimal prediction-aware\npolicy tractably. Second, we develop a novel \\emph{Bellman-Jensen Gap} analysis\non the Bayesian value function, which enables characterizing the value of\nimperfect predictions. Third, we introduce BOLA (Bayesian Offline Learning with\nOnline Adaptation), a two-stage model-based RL algorithm that separates offline\nBayesian value learning from lightweight online adaptation to real-time\npredictions. We prove that BOLA remains sample-efficient even under imperfect\npredictions. We validate our theory and algorithm on synthetic MDPs and a\nreal-world wind energy storage control problem."}

Recent data-driven methods based\non deep learning have achieved significant success in the medium range, but\nstruggle at longer subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) horizons due to error\naccumulation in their autoregressive approach. In this work, we propose\nOmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather\nforecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model\nthat encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent\nspace, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of\nfuture latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we\nmask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their\ndistribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion\nhead. During inference, the transformer generates the full sequence of future\ntokens by iteratively unmasking random subsets of tokens. This joint sampling\nacross space and time mitigates compounding errors from autoregressive\napproaches. The low-dimensional latent space enables modeling long sequences of\nfuture latent states, allowing the transformer to learn weather dynamics beyond\ninitial conditions. OmniCast performs competitively with leading probabilistic\nmethods at the medium-range timescale while being 10x to 20x faster, and\nachieves state-of-the-art performance at the subseasonal-to-seasonal scale\nacross accuracy, physics-based, and probabilistic metrics.

Specifically, we evaluate the\nperformance of state-of-the-art open-source LLMs such as TinyLLaMA,\nFalcon-RW-1B, and Flan-T5 by prompting them to generate plausible passwords\nbased on structured user attributes (e.g., name, birthdate, hobbies). Our\nresults, measured using Hit@1, Hit@5, and Hit@10 metrics under both plaintext\nand SHA-256 hash comparisons, reveal consistently poor performance, with all\nmodels achieving less than 1.5% accuracy at Hit@10. In contrast, traditional\nrule-based and combinator-based cracking methods demonstrate significantly\nhigher success rates. Through detailed analysis and visualization, we identify\nkey limitations in the generative reasoning of LLMs when applied to the\ndomain-specific task of password guessing. Our findings suggest that, despite\ntheir linguistic prowess, current LLMs lack the domain adaptation and\nmemorization capabilities required for effective password inference, especially\nin the absence of supervised fine-tuning on leaked password datasets. This\nstudy provides critical insights into the limitations of LLMs in adversarial\ncontexts and lays the groundwork for future efforts in secure,\nprivacy-preserving, and robust password modeling."}

With the\nadvent of agentic workflows, multi-turn dialogue has become the de facto mode\nof interaction with LLMs for completing long and complex tasks. While LLM\ncapabilities continue to improve, they remain increasingly susceptible to\njailbreaking, especially in multi-turn scenarios where harmful intent can be\nsubtly injected across the conversation to produce nefarious outcomes. While\nsingle-turn attacks have been extensively explored, adaptability, efficiency\nand effectiveness continue to remain key challenges for their multi-turn\ncounterparts. To address these gaps, we present PLAGUE, a novel plug-and-play\nframework for designing multi-turn attacks inspired by lifelong-learning\nagents. PLAGUE dissects the lifetime of a multi-turn attack into three\ncarefully designed phases (Primer, Planner and Finisher) that enable a\nsystematic and information-rich exploration of the multi-turn attack family.\nEvaluations show that red-teaming agents designed using PLAGUE achieve\nstate-of-the-art jailbreaking results, improving attack success rates (ASR) by\nmore than 30% across leading models in a lesser or comparable query budget.\nParticularly, PLAGUE enables an ASR (based on StrongReject) of 81.4% on\nOpenAI's o3 and 67.3% on Claude's Opus 4.1, two models that are considered\nhighly resistant to jailbreaks in safety literature. Our work offers tools and\ninsights to understand the importance of plan initialization, context\noptimization and lifelong learning in crafting multi-turn attacks for a\ncomprehensive model vulnerability evaluation."}

Ideally, such\nevaluation should allow the model builder to assess the utility of candidate\ndata without exposing proprietary details of the model. At the same time, data\nproviders must be assured that no information about their data - beyond the\ncomputed utility score - is disclosed to the model builder.\n  In this paper, we present PrivaDE, a cryptographic protocol for\nprivacy-preserving utility scoring and selection of data for machine learning.\nWhile prior works have proposed data evaluation protocols, our approach\nadvances the state of the art through a practical, blockchain-centric design.\nLeveraging the trustless nature of blockchains, PrivaDE enforces\nmalicious-security guarantees and ensures strong privacy protection for both\nmodels and datasets. To achieve efficiency, we integrate several techniques -\nincluding model distillation, model splitting, and cut-and-choose\nzero-knowledge proofs - bringing the runtime to a practical level. Furthermore,\nwe propose a unified utility scoring function that combines empirical loss,\npredictive entropy, and feature-space diversity, and that can be seamlessly\nintegrated into active-learning workflows. Evaluation shows that PrivaDE\nperforms data evaluation effectively, achieving online runtimes within 15\nminutes even for models with millions of parameters.\n  Our work lays the foundation for fair and automated data marketplaces in\ndecentralized machine learning ecosystems."}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has the potential to\nenhance LLMs for secure code generation by incorporating external security\nknowledge. However, the conventional RAG design struggles with the noise of raw\nsecurity-related documents, and existing retrieval methods overlook the\nsignificant security semantics implicitly embedded in task descriptions. To\naddress these issues, we propose RESCUE, a new RAG framework for secure code\ngeneration with two key innovations. First, we propose a hybrid knowledge base\nconstruction method that combines LLM-assisted cluster-then-summarize\ndistillation with program slicing, producing both high-level security\nguidelines and concise, security-focused code examples. Second, we design a\nhierarchical multi-faceted retrieval to traverse the constructed knowledge base\nfrom top to bottom and integrates multiple security-critical facts at each\nhierarchical level, ensuring comprehensive and accurate retrieval. We evaluated\nRESCUE on four benchmarks and compared it with five state-of-the-art secure\ncode generation methods on six LLMs. The results demonstrate that RESCUE\nimproves the SecurePass@1 metric by an average of 4.8 points, establishing a\nnew state-of-the-art performance for security. Furthermore, we performed\nin-depth analysis and ablation studies to rigorously validate the effectiveness\nof individual components in RESCUE."}
