This\noverhead notably impacts HPC workloads involving intensive inter-processor\ncommunication. In response, we introduce MPI-over-CXL, a novel MPI\ncommunication paradigm leveraging CXL, which provides cache-coherent shared\nmemory across multiple hosts. MPI-over-CXL replaces traditional data-copy\nmethods with direct shared memory access, significantly reducing communication\nlatency and memory bandwidth usage. By mapping shared memory regions directly\ninto the virtual address spaces of MPI processes, our design enables efficient\npointer-based communication, eliminating redundant copying operations. To\nvalidate this approach, we implement a comprehensive hardware and software\nenvironment, including a custom CXL 3.2 controller, FPGA-based multi-host\nemulation, and dedicated software stack. Our evaluations using representative\nbenchmarks demonstrate substantial performance improvements over conventional\nMPI systems, underscoring MPI-over-CXL's potential to enhance efficiency and\nscalability in large-scale HPC environments."}

Specifically,\nthe antenna rotation vector (ARV) and antenna weight vector (AWV) are jointly\noptimized to maximize the minimum array gain over signal directions, subject to\na given constraint on the maximum array gain over interference directions. For\nthe special case of single-beam forming without interference, the optimal ARV\nis derived in closed-form with the maximum ratio combining (MRC) beamformer\napplied to the AWV.

This reframes merging as generating a\nreconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.\nCrucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,\nrecognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized\nfor its task.

Many existing\ndefences are vulnerable when attackers exploit subtle distance-based anomalies\nor when clean examples are scarce. To meet this challenge, we introduce TED++,\na submanifold-aware framework that effectively detects subtle backdoors that\nevade existing defences. TED++ begins by constructing a tubular neighbourhood\naround each class's hidden-feature manifold, estimating its local ``thickness''\nfrom a handful of clean activations. It then applies Locally Adaptive Ranking\n(LAR) to detect any activation that drifts outside the admissible tube. By\naggregating these LAR-adjusted ranks across all layers, TED++ captures how\nfaithfully an input remains on the evolving class submanifolds. Based on such\ncharacteristic ``tube-constrained'' behaviour, TED++ flags inputs whose\nLAR-based ranking sequences deviate significantly. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on benchmark datasets and tasks, demonstrating that TED++ achieves\nstate-of-the-art detection performance under both adaptive-attack and\nlimited-data scenarios. Remarkably, even with only five held-out examples per\nclass, TED++ still delivers near-perfect detection, achieving gains of up to\n14\\% in AUROC over the next-best method.

We introduce an online per state action\nestimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior\nstate within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term\nduring temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility\nawareness directly into the value function.

A feedback link from the Base Station (BS) to the user is\nadopted to enable dynamic power control of the user pilot transmissions in the\nuplink. A novel multi-agent algorithm for the joint control of the RIS phase\nconfiguration and the user transmit power is presented, which is based on a\nhybrid approach integrating NeuroEvolution (NE) and supervised learning. The\nproposed scheme requires only single-bit feedback messages for the uplink power\ncontrol, supports RIS elements with discrete responses, and is numerically\nshown to outperform fingerprinting, deep reinforcement learning baselines and\nbackpropagation-based position estimators."}

By decomposing difficult tasks with long contexts into\nshorter, manageable ones, recent multi-agent paradigms offer a promising\nnear-term solution to this problem. However, the fundamental capacities of such\nsystems are poorly understood. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework\nto analyze the expressivity of multi-agent systems. We apply our framework to\nthree algorithmic families: state tracking, recall, and $k$-hop reasoning. We\nderive bounds on (i) the number of agents required to solve the task exactly,\n(ii) the quantity and structure of inter-agent communication, and (iii) the\nachievable speedups as problem size and context scale. Our results identify\nregimes where communication is provably beneficial, delineate tradeoffs between\nagent count and bandwidth, and expose intrinsic limitations when either\nresource is constrained. We complement our theoretical analysis with a set of\nexperiments on pretrained LLMs using controlled synthetic benchmarks. Empirical\noutcomes confirm the tradeoffs between key quantities predicted by our theory.\nCollectively, our analysis offers principled guidance for designing scalable\nmulti-agent reasoning systems."}

Existing prompt\ninjection detection methods often have sub-optimal performance and/or high\ncomputational overhead. In this work, we propose PIShield, a detection method\nthat is both effective and efficient. Our key observation is that the internal\nrepresentation of the final token in a prompt-extracted from a specific layer\nof the LLM, which we term the injection-critical layer-captures distinguishing\nfeatures between clean and contaminated prompts. Leveraging this insight, we\ntrain a simple linear classifier on these internal representations using a\nlabeled set of clean and contaminated prompts. We compare PIShield against 11\nbaselines across 5 diverse benchmark datasets and 8 prompt injection attacks.\nThe results demonstrate that PIShield is both highly effective and efficient,\nsubstantially outperforming existing methods. Additionally, we show that\nPIShield resists strong adaptive attacks."}

Although recent WF techniques achieve over 90% accuracy\nin controlled experimental settings, most studies remain confined to single\nscenarios, overlooking the complexity of real-world environments. This paper\npresents the first systematic and comprehensive evaluation of existing WF\nattacks under diverse realistic conditions, including defense mechanisms,\ntraffic drift, multi-tab browsing, early-stage detection, open-world settings,\nand few-shot scenarios. Experimental results show that many WF techniques with\nstrong performance in isolated settings degrade significantly when facing other\nconditions. Since real-world environments often combine multiple challenges,\ncurrent WF attacks are difficult to apply directly in practice. This study\nhighlights the limitations of WF attacks and introduces a multidimensional\nevaluation framework, offering critical insights for developing more robust and\npractical WF attacks."}

However, existing\nMPC frameworks are not optimized for sparse data. This makes them unsuitable\nfor ML applications involving sparse data, e.g., recommender systems or\ngenomics. Even in plaintext, such applications involve high-dimensional sparse\ndata, that cannot be processed without sparsity-related optimizations due to\nprohibitively large memory requirements.\n  Since matrix multiplication is central in ML algorithms, we propose MPC\nalgorithms to multiply secret sparse matrices. On the one hand, our algorithms\navoid the memory issues of the \"dense\" data representation of classic secure\nmatrix multiplication algorithms. On the other hand, our algorithms can\nsignificantly reduce communication costs (some experiments show a factor 1000)\nfor realistic problem sizes. We validate our algorithms in two ML applications\nin which existing protocols are impractical.\n  An important question when developing MPC algorithms is what assumptions can\nbe made. In our case, if the number of non-zeros in a row is a sensitive piece\nof information then a short runtime may reveal that the number of non-zeros is\nsmall. Existing approaches make relatively simple assumptions, e.g., that there\nis a universal upper bound to the number of non-zeros in a row. This often\ndoesn't align with statistical reality, in a lot of sparse datasets the amount\nof data per instance satisfies a power law. We propose an approach which allows\nadopting a safe upper bound on the distribution of non-zeros in rows/columns of\nsparse matrices."}
